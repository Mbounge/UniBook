AboutPrinciples of Finance
Summary
Principles of Financeis targeted at the core finance course for undergraduate business majors. The book is
designed for conceptual accessibility to students who are relatively early in their business curriculum (such as
second-year students), yet it is also suitable for more advanced students. Due to the wide range of audiences
and course approaches, the book is designed to be as flexible as possible. Its modular structure allows the
introduction and review of content from prerequisite subjects in financial accounting, statistics, and
Preface1

economics, depending on student preparation. It provides a solid grounding in the core concepts of financial
theory so that business students interested in a major or minor in finance will also be prepared for more
rigorous upper-level courses. Concepts are further reinforced through applicable connections and practical
calculation techniques for more detailed and realistic company scenarios from various industries.
Pedagogical Foundation
Principles of Financeemphasizes financial concepts relevant to people working in a variety of business
functions. To illuminate the meaningful applications and implications of financial ideas, the book incorporates
a unique use-case approach, providing connections among topics, solutions, and real-world problems. This
multifaceted framework drives the integration of concepts while maintaining a modular chapter structure.
Theoretical and practical aspects are presented in a balanced manner, and select ethical considerations are
introduced, particularly in the context of corporate governance.
In order to create meaning for all students,Principles of Financeexposes them to a range of companies,
industries, and scenarios reflecting different contexts. Examples of large companies such as Apple, Peloton,
and American Airlines are balanced with small businesses—coffee shops, clothing stores, and salons—that
may be more aligned with student experiences. The text includes authentic narratives from corporate finance,
small business, and personal finance to drive relevance and interest of the discipline. Profiles and interviews
include diverse figures in finance, such as Carlos Slim, Irina Simmons, Janet Yellen, and Ben Bernanke.
Problems and exercises have been carefully constructed to place students into a range of settings and
contexts as they develop knowledge and put it into practice. Finally, to reflect very recent experiences, the
authors have incorporated several discussions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on people
and businesses.
Throughout, there is an emphasis on data use in business decision-making, with integrative sections on the
importance and analysis of financial, economic, and statistical data. Data types includeFRED
(https://openstax.org/r/fred-stlouisfed)® economic data, company financial statements, and stock prices.
Practical techniques and calculation examples for data analysis with financial calculators (the Texas
Instruments BA II Plus™ Professional model is used as the basis for example illustrations) and/or spreadsheets
are included for relevant topics. For key chapters, downloadable Microsoft® Excel® data files are available for
student reference. This technical feature provides students with access to the Excel data files used in the
chapter examples for time value of money (Chapters 7,8,9) and statistics (Chapters 14,15,16) problems. The
downloadable files for the chapters covering financial forecasting and trade credit (18and19) allow students
to see how changing assumptions and variables impact financial decision-making.Chapters 13and14
(statistical and regression analysis, respectively) also include brief sections about theR software
(https://openstax.org/r/r-software)package to promote further interest in trends in data science.
Teaching Plan Options
Principles of Financeincludes chapters on basic, applied, and integrative finance topics as well as key concepts
from prerequisite financial accounting, quantitative methods (statistics), and economics courses. The chapters
on prerequisite topics highlight examples relevant to finance students. For instructors with a limited one-
semester schedule or whose students have solid knowledge of prerequisite disciplines, we recommend
focusing on the “core” chapters, as indicated in the following table of contents:

Why It Matters
Finance is essential to the management of a business or organization. Without good financial protocol,
safeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-
owned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of
commercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family
ownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam
War, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest
rates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national
economy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.
In the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that
the custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The
owner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a
production, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger
companies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a
commitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs’ reputation for quality
grew, so did demand for its products. The original financing plan anticipated this potential growth and was

designed to meet anticipated capital requirements so that the firm could expand how and when it needed to.
Bacon Signs’ ability to manufacture and deliver a high-quality product at a good price was the true value of the
firm. However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would
not have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and
financial stability for the firm.

people make consistently good and repeatable decisions.
1.1What Is Finance?
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Describe the main areas in finance.
•Explain the importance of studying finance.
•Discuss the concepts of risk and return.
Definition of Finance
Finance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The wordfinancecan be used as a
verb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as
a noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and
sources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better
decision makers.
Basic Areas in Finance
Finance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and
financial markets and institutions (seeFigure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.
Figure1.2The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance
Business Finance
Business financelooks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a
risky environment. Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the
company, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.
Consequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this
decision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”
In business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (seeFigure 1.3).

1.Working capital management(WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.
The chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for
how to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for
the extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-
term creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department’s
policies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others,
they are separate.
2.Capital budgetingis the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to
maximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital
budgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital
budgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,
timing, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and
compiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,
and economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the
value of the firm.
3.Capital structureis the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and
increasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with
economists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial
information and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included
each of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.
Figure1.3How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet
Figure 1.3demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are
related to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital
budgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt
and equity financing.
Investments
Investmentsare products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics
include the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,
regulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative
securities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual
funds,exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as401k plansorindividual retirement
accounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common
discussion topics and investment opportunities.
Investments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such asBillions
and movies such asWall Streetmake investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,

depending on the situation and the attitude of the viewer. In these programs, the players and their decisions
can lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy
of the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and
business investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry
as personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.
Financial Markets and Institutions
Financial markets and institutionsare the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.
There is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking
and need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in
our economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual
investment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.
Much of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a
response to thestock market crash of 1929and the subsequentGreat Depression. In the United States, the
desire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our
primary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. TheSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC)was
formed with the passage of theSecurities Act of 1933andSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank
regulation in the form of theGlass-Steagall Act (1933)and theBanking Act of 1935gave rise to government-
backed bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.
These regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and
investment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial
advice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and
loans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal
lending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.
Today, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or
worked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank
operations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking
has narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial
system, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and
prosper.
TheFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)formed in 2007 to consolidate and replace existing
regulatory bodies. FINRA is an independent, nongovernmental organization that writes and enforces the rules
governing registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States. TheSecurities Investor
Protection Corporation (SIPC)is a nonprofit corporation created by an act of Congress to protect the clients
of brokerage firms that declare bankruptcy. SIPC is an insurance that provides brokerage customers up to
$500,000 coverage for cash and securities held by the firm.
The regulation of the financial industry kicked into high gear in the 1930s and for those times and conditions
was a necessary development of our financial industry and regulatory oversight. Deregulation of the finance
industry beginning in the 1970s was a necessary pendulum swing in the opposite direction toward more
market-based and less restrictive regulation and oversight.The Great Recession of 2007–2009resulted in the
reregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has
swung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
The Great Recession
The Great Recession of 2007–2009 exposed many of the weaknesses of our financial system. The ease with
which banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the
resulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.
Regulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the
Federal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and
potential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.
2
He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic
response to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct
the underlying causes of the recession.
One immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy
illiquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically
this was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,
however, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,
most financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.
However, individual homeowners suffered greatly.
The Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by
reorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important
financial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect
consumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial
institutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left
out in the cold due to actions beyond their control.

Why We Study Finance
Finance is the lubricant that keeps our economy running smoothly. Issuing a mortgage can be profitable for a
bank, but it also allows people to live in their own homes and to pay for them over time. DoMasterCard,
Venmo, andPayPalmake money when you use their product? Sure, but think how much more convenient and
safer it is to carry a card or use an app instead of cash. In addition, these services allow you to easily track
where and how you spend your money. A well-regulated and independent financial system is important to
capital-based economies. Our smoothly functioning financial system has removed us from the days of strictly
bartering to our system today, where transactions are as simple as a tap on your mobile phone.
There are any number of professional and personal reasons to study finance. A search of the internet provides
a long list of finance-related professions. Interviews with senior managers reveal that an understanding of
financial tools and concepts is an important consideration in hiring new employees. Financial skills are among

the most important tools for advancement toward greater responsibility and remuneration. Government and
work-guaranteed pension benefits are growing less common and less generous, meaning individuals must
take greater responsibility for their personal financial well-being now and at retirement. Let’s take a closer
look at some of the reasons why we study finance.
There are many career opportunities in the fields of finance. A single course in finance such as this one may
pique your interest and encourage you to study more finance-related topics. These studies in turn may qualify
you for engaging and high-paying finance careers. We take a closer look at financial career opportunities in
Careers in Finance.
A career in finance is just one reason to study finance. Finance is an excellent decision-making tool; it requires
analytical thinking. Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing,
magnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as
well, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or
paychecks.
An understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment
opportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real
estate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,
and adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and
cryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage
of both new and old financial products.

Job Information
The internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.

Labor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you. Think about

career path and is intellectually stimulating and satisfying.
Risk and Return in Finance
Finance tells us that an increase in risk results in an increase in expected return. The study of historical
financial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over
time have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,
where’s the risk?
At its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps
individuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in
our everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or
walking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.
Should you buy the required text for your class or instead rely on the professor’s notes and the internet?
Should you buy that new-to-you used car sight unseen, or should you spend the money for a mechanic to
assess the vehicle before you buy? Should you accept your first job offer at graduation or hold out for the offer
you really want? A better understanding of finance makes these types of decisions easier and can provide you,
as the decision maker, with statistics instead of just intuition.
Return is compensation for making an investment and waiting for the benefit (seeFigure 1.4). Return could be
121 • Introduction to Finance

the interest earned on an investment in a bond or the dividend from the purchase of stock. Return could be
the higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education.
Individuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the
expectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds
were the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings
account, and that means investors expect a greater average return.
The study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-
return trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different
definitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the
characteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar “bell-shaped” curve you studied in your statistics
classes. Understanding a security’s average and variability of returns can help us estimate the range and
likelihood of higher- or lower-than-expected outcomes. This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate
prices that satisfy investors’ required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or
uncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”
Figure1.4Risk and Expected ReturnThis describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is
willing to accept the risk of possible loss.
The overall uncertainty of returns has several components.
•Default riskon a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For
example, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on
required semiannual interest payments on a bond.
•Inflation riskoccurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an
investment due to rising prices or inflation.
•Diversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or
smallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these
situations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.
•Non-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated
unnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term calledbeta.
Subsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.
•Political riskis associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers.
This is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash
flows. Political risk could come about due to zoning changes, product liability decisions, taxation, or even
nationalization of a firm or industry.
1.1 • What Is Finance?13

1.2The Role of Finance in an Organization
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Describe the finance function.
•Explain the role of finance and its importance within an organization.
The Finance Function
Finance has many functions within an organization, and there are many job titles to reflect the varied job
responsibilities. Thecomptroller, or more commonly acontroller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a
knowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting
activities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts
receivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and
liability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for
monitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.
In most organizations, thetreasurermight assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the
treasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for
bankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring
loan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also
responsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the
treasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.
Thevice president of finance (VP-F)is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller
and treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that
generates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.
Thechief financial officer, orCFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital
management, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of
capital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting
financial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and
strategic planning.
Financial Planning
Financial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.
Financial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions
required to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.
These could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,
partners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning
helps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue
objectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning
process, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans
typically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as
the development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was
thorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial
banks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.
Good financial planning has a number of common features.
•It uses past, current, andpro forma(forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements
are created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income
statements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.
141 • Introduction to Finance

•Cash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the
timing and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.
•Balance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most
important aspects of business is accounting (seeFigure 1.5).
•Forecasting in the form of expected sales, cost of funds, and microeconomic and macroeconomic
conditions are essential elements of financial planning.
•Financial analysis including ratio analysis, common-size financial statements, and trend statements are
important aspects of financial planning. Such analysis aids in the understanding of where a firm has been,
how it stacks up against the competition, and the assessment of target objectives.
Figure1.5The Accounting SystemThe accounting system relies on accurate data used to prepare all the financial reports that help
to evaluate a firm.

Forecasting and Budgeting
Forecasting and budgeting are common practices for businesses, governmental agencies, not-for-profit firms,
and individual households. As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are
valuable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of
cash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget
well before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by
developing financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the
future. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its
objectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and
magnitude of expected cash flows.
Financial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify
the differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those
changes. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is
everything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and
government. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps
navigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.
The budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and
balance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives
and serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to
1.2 • The Role of Finance in an Organization15

determine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The
process should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a
periodic renewal and reminder of the firm’s goals.
Financial forecasting often starts with the firm’s budget and recommends changes based on differences
between the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in
the immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.
1.3Importance of Data and Technology
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Describe the role of data in finance.
•List and describe the various types of corporate data available.
•Explain how the various types of corporate data can be accessed and analyzed.
•Describe the impact of data digitization.
•Explain how stakeholders use data when making decisions.
Importance of Data
Financial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data
leads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the
creation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,
and balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders
such as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having
current and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform
managers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to
make regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”
decision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.
Outsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory
decisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial
information. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need
data to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should
supply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.
Basic Data Types
Financial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and
develop at least three essential financial statements or reports.
1.The income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income
statements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.
2.Statements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.
3.Balance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.
These statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as
accumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look
forward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.
In addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek
external sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market
research, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with
government officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,
unemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.

The Impact of Digitization
Data digitizationmakes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective. Some data starts
out as digital data, such as that from aMicrosoft Suiteproduct. The Excel files and Word documents we create
are ubiquitous and easily stored and transmitted.Cloud storageandvideo conferencingare now the norm.
Emails and Zoom meetings are quick, easy, and inexpensive ways to share and store information. Businesses
now create ane-trail, or virtual paper trail, to document, verify, and share processes. Because data is now
much easier to access, firms bear the added responsibility of ensuring that it is stored and secured properly so
that individuals cannot inappropriately alter or delete information.
Data storage has changed significantly in the last decade as companies have moved the storage of digital data
to the cloud. The advantages include only paying for the storage actually used, reduced energy consumption,
access to specialized data protection services, and software and hardware maintenance. However, the risk of
data hacks and the safety of data are key concerns in the storage of digitized information.
Uses of Data
Taken together and separately, the internally generated financial statements can provide managers with a
wealth of information to enable superior decision-making. Harvard Business School identifies six ways
managers can use financial statements.

1.Measuring the impact of business decisions such as new software, marketing plan, or product line
2.Aiding in the development of budgets by creating a starting point for future expectations
3.Aiding in cost cutting or the reduction of duplicate activities
4.Providing data-supported strategic planning and visioning
5.Ensuring consistent data and content across departments
6.Motivating teams to set, meet, and exceed goals and objectives
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
How and Why Managers Use Financial Statements: The Case of Peloton
Should you lease a new car or buy one? Do you opt for the more expensive high-tech production
equipment or reduce your upfront investment and pay higher labor costs over time? Is it better to finance a
new product by borrowing money or selling new shares of stock? Should you manufacture overseas where
the production costs are lower or in your own country where political and transportation costs are lower?
Once you make your choice, how do you know if you’ve made the right decision? Understanding and
applying financial principles can help.
For example, considerPeloton, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In
2012, the principal founder, JohnFoley, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to
attend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family. He enjoyed cycling classes,
but they could be expensive and often did not fit into his schedule. He recognized that the most popular
instructors had developed a bit of a cult following and that the music playlist was a critical component for
many followers. His choice of the company name, Peloton, comes from the French word for a “pack of bike
riders,” familiar to anyone who has even loosely followed the annual Tour de France bike race. The
company name evokes a measure of mystique and prestige.
Peloton started small and underwent five funding rounds in seven years before the company went public
with an initial public offering in September 2019. Foley and his friends had the idea that they were a
“purposeful music company” and needed to touch on all aspects of the workout experience including the

bike; video, audio, and music content; clothing design; competition among the riders; data gathering; and
instructors for livestream and on-demand classes. They were selling an experience, not a bicycle. The
equipment is expensive—a Peloton bike typically costs over $2,000. Peloton equips its studios with state-of-
the-art camera and music systems and pays its instructors top dollar. Along the way, the founders made
several critical financial decisions. They kept control of the firm by using private funding at the start.
How can we tell if Peloton has managed its resources well? The company started with $400,000 of funding
to develop a prototype in 2012. By 2018, firm value increased to $4 billion with yet another round of private
investor funding. As of April 2021, Peloton is a publicly traded company with a stock value of $34 billion. The
executives are sacrificing profits in the short term to generate growth and long-term profitability. The firm
uses its financial statements to identify sources and uses of funds, to test the effectiveness of advertising,
and to forecast future profitability. Analysts like the firm, the stock price is up, and by many financial
measures, Peloton has been a great success. Time will tell if the decisions made over the last several years
will lead to long-term profitability or if the company has overinvested in marketing only to miss current and

Job Opportunities in Finance: Market Trends
There are many career opportunities in the field of finance. TheBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)finds that as of
May 2020, the median income for finance-related positions was $72,250 versus the overall median income of
only $41,950. Further, the BLS predicts that close to an additional 500,000 new finance- and accounting-related
jobs will be created by 2029.

These new employment opportunities are in addition to the many openings that
will become available as baby boomers continue to retire and leave the workforce.
Several of the BLS-listed finance careers do not even have finance or associated wording in the career titles.
The BLS identifies finance skills as necessary for careers such as management analysts and market research
analysts and work in logistics. Of course, many careers traditionally encourage the study of finance. These
include job titles and descriptions such as these:
•Financial manager: Oversees aspects of and produces reports about an organization’s financial needs,
uses, and related activities
•Investment relations associate: Prepares and presents company financial data to investors and other
company stakeholders

Financial Analyst Roles
Many executive-level finance officers worked their way up via the role of financial analyst. Job descriptions vary
across firms, industries, and government organizations. However, the role of financial analyst usually includes
market research, financial forecasting, modeling, cost analysis, and comparative valuations. Financial analysts
gather data and produce financial reports in conjunction with multiple departments within a business or
organization. They rely on marketing and production personnel to provide accurate sales forecasts, and they
work with accountants to create accurate financial reports.
As a financial analyst, you need strong spreadsheet skills, the ability to develop financial models and pro forma
financial statements, outstanding analytical skills, and an overall understanding of business processes.
Financial analysts possess a well-diversified collection of business and communication skills, both quantitative
and qualitative.Figure 1.6lists some tasks that financial analysts must perform on a daily basis. Some firms
require an MBA or several years of business experience for their financial analysts.
1.4 • Careers in Finance19

Figure1.6Financial Analyst Tasks
Internal financial analysts are important for a successful firm or organization because their work can lead to
more efficient and cost-effective use of financial and nonfinancial resources. Responsibilities include keeping
current with market conditions, developing financial models, reconciling variance between forecasts and
outcomes, and serving as a resource for management. Financial analysts fulfill their responsibilities through
the development and analysis of financial data including ratio analysis, trend analysis, in-depth discussions
with division managers, and the presentation and interpretation of information at meetings and on electronic
platforms.
External financial analysts use similar resources and tools to evaluate financial instruments as an aid to
investment companies, investment and commercial bankers, and individual investors who rely on their
published reports. Various government agencies also use financial analysts to aid in regulatory oversight and
enforcement.
A report from a 2019 BLS survey determines that financial analysts earn an average salary of $81,590, and jobs
are predicted to grow at a faster-than-average rate of 5% through 2029.

Business (or Management) Analyst Roles
The job description for a business analyst looks much like that for a financial analyst. However, the strong
quantitative skills required for a financial analyst are less emphasized in favor of overall strategic thinking. A
successful business analyst is able to evaluate business opportunities by using analytical thinking, industry
best practices, process development, team building and organization, and information technology. They then
communicate optimal courses of action to executive decision makers to maximize value in alignment with the
vision and goals of the firm.
Business analysts can help develop strategy and tactics to move a firm forward. They aid in identifying
challenges and solutions. Data-driven solutions help get products to market more quickly, evaluate
performance, and optimize production and product mix. The Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies the following
as typical business analyst duties:
•Gathering information about problems to be solved or procedures to be improved
•Interviewing personnel and conducting onsite observations to determine the methods, equipment, and

The average salary for management analysts was $85,260 in May 2019, and the BLS projects 11% growth, or
about 94,000 new jobs, over the next decade.

1.5Markets and Participants
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Identify primary and secondary markets.
•Identify key market players.
Primary and Secondary Markets
Simply put, theprimary marketis the market for “new” securities, and thesecondary marketis the market
for “used” securities. Think of the primary market as equivalent to the sale of new cars and the secondary
market as equivalent to the sale of used cars. In practice, many market locales trade both new and used
securities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place
among individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of
Amazon,Facebook, orNikestock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the
information provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by
investors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.
Some, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.
Firms issue new shares of stock calledseasoned equity offerings (SEOs)orinitial public offerings (IPOs)into
the market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows
directly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares
issued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these
new securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary,
market transactions.
Extensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury Department auctions billions of
dollars of new Treasury securities. These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the
ongoing liquidity and long-term borrowing needs of the federal government. Again, subsequent trading of
this government debt occurs as secondary market transactions.
Key Market Players
Key market players in finance include dealers, brokers, financial intermediaries, and you and me. Each of these
players facilitates the exchange of products, information, and capital in different ways. The presence of these
players makes financial transactions, easier, faster, and safer—essentially more efficient. You and your friends
might engage in direct financial transactions, such as buying a coffee or borrowing money for a movie. These
are typically small transactions. However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need
advanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets
are broker markets and dealer markets, asFigure 1.7shows. The primary difference between broker and
dealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.
6Ibid.
1.5 • Markets and Participants21

Figure1.7Broker and Dealer Markets
Dealers
Financialdealersown the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,
they are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an
individual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.
Instead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current
bid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to
generate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price
(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a
security). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.
Dealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of theSecurities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and
disclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.
Brokers
Brokersact as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers
differ from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals
traditionally receive a commission on sales.
In the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and
expenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for
clients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or
platforms such asRobinhoodorE-Tradecharge no or very low commissions on many of their trade
executions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges. They also do not offer investment advice.
Full-service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full-
service brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management, as well as
execute transactions.Morgan StanleyandBank of America Merrill Lynchare examples of full-service brokers
that serve both institutional and individual investors.
Financial Intermediaries
Afinancial intermediary, such as a commercial bank or a mutual fund investment company, serves as an
intermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a
commercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment
company pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.
These transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to
buy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may

create a completely different security all together. For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan
created by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely
earning interest, and you are not directly affected.
Financial institutions usually facilitate financial intermediation. However, occasionally lenders and borrowers
are able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale,
the process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s,
inflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum
rates of 5% on their savings deposits.
7
Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest
directly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities. This lack of deposit funds and the
subsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant
deregulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.
The advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial
system through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and
fraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical
for the functioning of a capitalist economy.
1.6Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define microeconomics and macroeconomics.
•Discuss the relationship between microeconomics and macroeconomics.
•Explain the importance of macroeconomic variables in finance markets.
Microeconomics
In the business setting, finance is the intersection of economics and accounting. Financial decision makers rely
on economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for
their organization.Economicsis the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to
understand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and
consumers.
We typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics
is devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.
Microeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and
supply and demand.
Our understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding
how individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,
marketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and
government provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.
Macroeconomics
Whereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of
groups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and
unemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm
had to consider unemployment and inflation when estimating its price of labor and materials. Bacon Signs
also had to consider interest rates when estimating the cost of borrowing money to expand the business.
Macroeconomic modeling is limited because models cannot capture every variable in testing and application.

1.6 • Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters23

However, financial forecasting must incorporate macroeconomic assumptions and expectations into individual
firm and industry forecasts.Economic Foundationsexpands on our discussion of micro- and macroeconomics.
Importance of Macroeconomic Variables in Financial Markets
To make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several
economic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of
goods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic
conditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial
information hubs, such as theWall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such
as the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.
This information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial
forecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on
the cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.
The unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of
employers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services. The stock market is a
forward-looking macroeconomic variable and measures investor expectations about future cash flows and
economic growth. Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect
forecasting models.
LINK TO LEARNING
Politics and Stock Markets
Politics and stock market returns make for heated conversations. Who can run the country’s economic
system better,RepublicansorDemocrats? Presidents often take the credit or blame for overall economic
performance even though their actual influence is less than you might think. See this funcomparison chart
(https://openstax.org/r/macrotrends-net)of political economic performance that measures stock market
returns by each administration going back to President WarrenHardingin 1920. Who had the highest
overall increase in the market? What president in the 21st century oversaw an overall decline in the market?
Just to get things going, who had better overall market returns after four years in office, DonaldTrumpor
BarackObama?
Each of the variables we have identified—inflation, interest rates, unemployment, economic growth, the stock
market, and government fiscal policy—are macroeconomic factors. They are beyond the scope and influence
of individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete. A
better understanding of the interaction of these macro variables with each other and with individual micro or
firm-specific variables can only strengthen financial forecasting and management decision-making.
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Here, There, and Everywhere: Where Did Your iPhone Come From?
How do international macroeconomic factors affect investment decisions for businesses and individuals?
Foreign investment adds risk and potential return to the decision-making process. Macroeconomic factors
such as different inflation rates, unexpected changes in currency exchange rates, and mismatched
economic growth all add to the uncertainty of making investments abroad. Just as important are
government regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs. Toss in
a pandemic, and a bottleneck or two, and suddenly international macroeconomic factors can affect almost
every aspect of commerce and international trade.

Relationship between Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
In the parable, a group of blind people happen upon an elephant for the first time, and they each touch one
part—but one part only—of the elephant. Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered,
the descriptions are vastly different. The group's members become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate
descriptions or worse. The parable demonstrates how individuals can make absolute truths from their own
limited and subjective information. Financial decision makers run a similar risk, if they choose to recognize
only their own findings and ignore other microeconomic or macroeconomic information and the interaction of
these factors.
A common view to understanding economics states that macroeconomics is a top-down approach and
microeconomics is a bottom-up approach. Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the
individual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective. They need both the macro data, so
important for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement. For example, the national
rate of unemployment may not have been much help when Bacon Signs was searching for skilled laborers
who could form neon signs. However, the unemployment rate helped inform the company about the
probability of demand for new businesses and the signs they would need.

Money Markets and Instruments
Themoney marketis the market for short-term, low-risk, highly liquid securities. “Short-term” refers to
money market securitieshaving maturities of less than one year–sometimes as short as overnight. “Low
risk” specifically means that the probability of default by the issuer in very unlikely. Defaulting on money
market instruments is not unheard of, but it is very rare. “High liquidity” means that money market
instruments can generally be sold in a secondary market very quickly and at or near their current market
value. Finally, money market securities are homogeneous, meaning that within an issue of securities, a single

instrument is not unique. For example, if you purchase 13-week T-bills issued in the first week of January, each
bill is identical to any other in the issue. Compare that to the purchase of physical assets such as a car or
house, where each of the assets sold has some unique feature or measure of quality.
Financial institutions, corporations, and governments that have short-term borrowing and/or lending needs
issue securities in the money market. Most of the transactions are quite large, with typical amounts in excess
of $100,000. These large transactions are the norm when trading federal funds, repurchase agreements,
commercial paper, or negotiable certificates of deposit. Our sample company, Bacon Signs, was much too
small to participate directly in the money market. However, Bacon Signs’ borrowing rates were affected by
changes in the money market. Treasury bills are also a very important component of the money market, and
they trade in smaller amounts starting at $10,000 per T-bill.
Treasury bills (T-bills), are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are
auctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short
maturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local
income taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt
securities. In addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where
investors can trade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills
has exceeded $75 billion.
9
Commercial paper (CP)is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial
institutions to meet short-term financing needs such as for inventory and receivables. For example, credit card
companies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper has a maturity of one to
270 days. The short maturity reduces SEC oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP
means that only highly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper. The default rate on commercial
paper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range during the financial crisis of
2008.
Commercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount with the face
value as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue
commercial paper; thus, returns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for
CP. Most purchasers are large, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial
paper until maturity.
Negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs)are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are
redeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.
NCDs, orjumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical
minimums amounts are $1,000,000 with a maturity of two weeks to six months.
NCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or
credit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit
insurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty
from the issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount but is much larger than a
regular CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to
cash out early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher
rates on NCDs compared to CDs because they know they will have use of the purchase amount for the entire
maturity of the NCD. The reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve are also lower than for other
types of deposits.
The market forfederal fundsis notable because the Federal Reserve targets the equilibrium interest rate on

federal funds as one of its most important monetary policy tools. The federal funds market traditionally
consists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial
institutions, notably domestic commercial banks. The participants in the market negotiate the federal funds
interest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate range in the federal funds
market by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market. Many of the borrowing and lending
rates in our economy are a direct function of the federal funds rate.
Capital Markets and Instruments
Thecapital marketis the market for longer-term financial instruments. The capital market is similar to the
money market. However, maturities are longer, default risk varies to a greater degree from low to high, and
liquidity is less certain, as is the homogeneity of the financial instruments. Broadly, we separate capital market
instruments into debt instruments traded in the bond markets and equity securities traded on the stock
markets.
The federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to raise money for current spending and to repay
past borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large, as the US federal government over the years
has accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion.
10
Treasury notesare US government debt instruments with maturities of 2 to 10 years. The Treasury auctions
notes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov in the same way they
would a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in that they are longer term, pay semiannual coupon interest
payments, and pay the par or face value of the note at maturity. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and
timing of note payments is fixed. However, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change.
Like T-bills, T-notes are generally exempt from state and local taxes. There is an active secondary market for
Treasury notes.
Longer-term Treasury issues,Treasury bonds, have maturities of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds are like T-notes in
that they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at
maturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates.
State and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form ofmunicipal bonds (“munis”).
Local borrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is unlikely but possible.
Thus, munis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to that of corporate bonds in that they receive a bond
rating based on the perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest
payments are tax-free. Interest on munis is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from
state and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.
Just as governments borrow money in the long-term from investors, so do corporations. A corporation often
issues bonds for longer-term financing. Bond contracts identify very specific terms of agreement and outline
the rules for the order, timing, and amount of contractual payments, as well as processes for when one or
more of the required activities lapse. A bond contract, known as an indenture, includes both standard
“boilerplate” contract language and specific conditions unique to a particular issue. Because of these non-
standardized features of a bond contract, the secondary market for trading used bonds typically requires a
broker, dealer, or investment company to facilitate a trade.
An important goal of business executives is to maximize the owners’ wealth. For corporations, shares of stock
represent ownership. Stocks are difficult to price compared to bonds. Bonds have contracts that specify the
number and amount of all payments made by the firm to the purchasers of bonds. Stock cash flows are far
more uncertain than bond cash flows. Stocks might or might not have periodic dividend payments, and an
investor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future. However, no contract guarantees the size of the
dividends or the time or resale price of the stock. Thus, the cash flows from stock ownership are more

uncertain and risky than cash flows from bonds.
Ownership of corporations is easily transferable if a company’s stock trades in one of the organized stock
exchanges or in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Most of the trading consists of used or previously issued
stocks in the over-the-counter market and organized exchanges. The two largest stock exchanges in the world
are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. Both exchanges are located in the United States.
1.8Concepts of Time and Value
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain the impact of time on saving and spending.
•Describe economic value.
Many students don’t have a choice between saving and spending. College is expensive, and it is easy to spend
every dollar you earn and to borrow to meet the rest of your obligations. Businesses, however, continually
make decisions about when and how much money to borrow or invest. Bacon Signs established banking
relationships to borrow money when needed to expand the business or a product line. Sometimes the best
decision is to invest as soon as possible to grab opportunities, and other times it is better to delay new
investment in order to pay dividends to the owners of the company.

much. Here we are over 100 years later, and the Dow 30 index is alive and well. Of course, the 30 companies

tenfold, from a value of 100 to a value of 1,000. The next tenfold increase from 1,000 to 10,000 took only a
little under 27 years from 1972 to 1999. Time will tell if or when the Dow 30 will top 100,000 at the closing
bell.

Impact of Time on Saving and Spending
The choice to spend or save and invest is really a choice between consumption today versus consumption in

the future. Economists, investment advisers, your friends, and mine love to discuss the trade-off of
consumption now or later—even if not in those words. We have all heard conversations that go something like
this: “Let’s go grab a beer—you can study for tomorrow’s exam in the morning.” Or “My father’s investment
adviser told me that if I invest $500 per month for the next 30 years and earn an annual rate of 10% on my
investments, I will have invested $180,000 over time but accumulated an investment portfolio worth over $1.13
million!”
An important aspect of the trade-off between saving and spending involves your short-, intermediate-, and
long-term goals. Delaying consumption until later comes with risks. Will your consumption choices still be
available? Will the prices be attainable? Will you still be able to consume and enjoy your future purchases?
When saving for short-term objectives, the safety of the principal invested is important, and the value of
compounding returns is minimal compared to longer-term investments. Most short-term investors have a low
tolerance for risk and hope to beat the rate of inflation with a little extra besides. An example could be to start
a holiday savings account at your local bank as a way to save, earn a small rate of return, and assure that you
have funds set aside for consumption at the end of the year.
An intermediate investment may be to save for a new car or for the down payment on a house or vacation
home. Again, maintaining the principal is important, but you have some time to recover from poor investment
returns. Intermediate-term investments tend to earn higher average annual rates of return than short-term
investments, but they also have greater uncertainty and risk.
Long-term investments have the advantage of enough time to recover from temporary poor performance and
the luxury of compounded returns over a long period. Further, long-term investments tend to have greater
risk and higher expected average annual rates of return. Even though this is a business finance text,
sometimes a personal finance example is easier to relate to. To illustrate,Table 1.2demonstrates four different
investment scenarios. In scenario 1, you invest $5,000 annually from ages 26 through 60 into an account
earning an average annual rate of return of 10% per year. Over your lifetime, you invest a total of $175,000,
and at age 60, you have an estimated portfolio value of $1,490,634. This is a healthy amount that has almost
certainly beaten the average annual rate of inflation. In scenario 1, by investing regularly, you accumulate
roughly 8.5 times the value of what you invested. Congratulations, you can expect to become a millionaire!
Compare your results in scenario 1 with your college roommate in scenario 2, who is able to invest $5,000 per
year from ages 19 through 25 and leave her investments until age 60 in an account that continues to earn an
annual rate of 10%. She makes her investments earlier than yours, but they total only $35,000. However,
despite a much smaller investment, her head start advantage and the high average annual compounded rate
of return leave her with an expected portfolio value of $1,466,369. Her total is almost as great as the amount
you would accumulate, but with a much smaller total investment.
Scenarios 3 and 4 are even more dramatic, as can be seen from a review ofTable 1.2. In both scenarios, only
five $5,000 investments are made, but they are made earlier in the investor’s life. Parents or grandparents
could make these investments on behalf of the recipients. In both scenarios, the portfolios grow to amounts
greater than those of you or your roommate with smaller total investments. The common factor is that greater
time leads to additional compounding of the investments and thus greater future values.

Definition of Economic Value
Valueis a term used frequently in business and especially in economics, accounting, and finance. Accountants
track, record, and display value in the form of financial statements and footnotes. The numbers they present
are “book values” and represent what has occurred. Financial people like to speak in terms of “market values.”
Market values are calculated using expected future cash flows discounted to today. Market values are the
prices that consumers pay for a product.Economic valueis what we believe consumers are actually willing to
pay for a product, service, or experience. For example, the price of a movie ticket may be $10, but there are
individuals who are willing to pay far more for the experience of watching a movie on the big screen.
Generally, the economic value is at least as great as the market value or current price of an asset. When Bacon
Signs planned for the future, the firm attempted to determine the economic value of its products when
creating an optimal mix of price and quantity sold. Firms that produce unique products for clients may have
multiple prices based on the estimated economic value of their good or service to the client. One way to think
about the difference between market value and economic value is that market value is what you have to pay,
while economic value is what you are willing to pay.

Summary
1.1What Is Finance?
Finance is the study of the trade-off between risk and expected return. There are three broad areas of finance:
business finance, investments, and financial markets and institutions.
1.2The Role of Finance in an Organization
The accounting department creates financial statements, and the finance department implements the firm’s
policy objectives, monitors results, and responds to necessary strategic and tactical changes. Finance is
responsible for budgeting and forecasting. Finance aids in establishing firm objectives and is responsible for
meeting with creditors, lenders, owners, regulators, and other stakeholders that provide capital to the firm or
have a claim against firm assets.
1.3Importance of Data and Technology
Much of the data used in business today has been available for many years. However, data today is more
attainable than ever due to technological advancements facilitating a user’s ability to gather, evaluate, and
store information faster and more cost effectively than ever. Information is continually available, so the
quicker and less expensively firms can adjust to the arrival of new information, the more valuable they become
for their stakeholders.
1.4Careers in Finance
Careers in finance are plentiful, fulfilling, and well compensated. Introductory positions are available in areas
such as data collection and data entry. More skill and experience is required for roles such as data analysis and
forecasting. Eventually, executive-level positions such as CFO present themselves to the most qualified.
Finance careers are not limited to financial firms, as understanding finance is an important skill in government
regulatory positions, nonprofit management, and all types of commercial business—from real estate, to retail,
to manufacturing, to education.
1.5Markets and Participants
Financial markets are where buyers and sellers of financial securities come together to trade. The trading of
securities allows markets to value assets and signal value as new information arrives. Brokers operate to bring
buyers and sellers together and receive commissions. Dealers trade from their own portfolios and are often
willing to make markets for specific securities by agreeing to buy or sell at the current bid and ask prices.
Financial intermediaries actually change or create new financial products.
1.6Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters
Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to understand the how and
why of human, physical, and financial capital allocation. Microeconomics is the study of factors affecting an
individual’s consumption, and macroeconomics is the study of all the aggregate factors affecting an economy.
Economics is important in finance due to the number of economic variables critical to good financial
forecasting.
1.7Financial Instruments
Maturity is one method to differentiate among financial instruments. Using this methodology, we have money
markets and capital markets. Money markets consist of short-term marketable securities, and capital markets
focus on longer-term securities such as bonds and stocks.
1.8Concepts of Time and Value
The concepts of time and value involve the resolution of conflict between consumption now versus
consumption later. Time and value represent the trade-off between risk and expected return. Many financial
1 • Summary31

exercises examine the relationships among time, interest rates, risk, cash flows now, and cash flows in the
future. You can expect to solve several “time value of money” problems before you complete this book.

Why It Matters
When someone opens a business, it is because they want to fulfill important personal financial goals. In
publicly traded companies, managers and employees work on behalf of the shareholders, who own the
business through their ownership of company stock. These managers and employees have an ongoing
obligation to pursue projects, policies, and corporate investments that will increase or promote stockholder
value over the long term. Although many companies focus on financially related goals, such as growth,
earnings per share, and market share, the main financial goal is to create value for investors.
Keep in mind that a company’s stockholders are not just an abstract group. Like the sole business owner, they
are individuals who have chosen to invest their hard-earned cash in a company. They are looking for a return
on their investment in order to meet their own personal long-term financial goals, which might be saving for
retirement, a new home, or college education for their children.
In addition to increasing value, it is also important to realize that a firm has important nonfinancial goals.
Some examples of these might include the following:
•Expanding sales to existing customers
•Increasing customer loyalty to the weaker brands
•Developing new products for current and potential customers
•Becoming international by setting up an online ordering service

2 • Why It Matters39

•Improving customer satisfaction with customer services
If managers are to help stockholders maximize their wealth, they must know how that wealth is determined in
the first place. One of the main concepts in finance is that the value of any asset is determined by the present
value of the stream of cash flows that the asset will provide to its owners over the course of time. In
subsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are
based on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.
For these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires
us to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that
affect a company’s value may not immediately be reflected in the price of a company’s stock but rather will
become evident in the long-term prospects of the organization.
In the case of privately held companies, smaller firms, and sole proprietorships, there are no shareholders.
However, attention to long-term growth and maximizing the value of a firm is just as important a goal to the
owners, who are also usually senior management with the company.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Identify the business form created by most organizations.
•Contrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over sole proprietorships.
•Contrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over partnerships.
•List and describe characteristics associated with a hybrid business structure.
The Most Common Types of Business Organization
The functions of most executive management teams are very similar for most businesses, and they will not
differ in any significant manner based on how they may be structured or organized. However, the legal
structure of any company will have a substantial impact on its operations, and it therefore deserves a
significant amount of analysis and discussion. The four most common forms of business organizations are the
following:
1.Sole proprietorships
2.Partnerships
3.Corporations
4.Hybrids, such as limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs)
The vast majority of businesses take the form of a proprietorship. However, based on the total dollar value of
combined sales, more than 80 percent of all business in the United States is conducted by acorporation.
1
Because corporations engage in the most business, and because most successful businesses eventually
convert into corporations, we will focus on corporations in this chapter. However, it is still important to
understand the legal differences between different types of firms and their advantages and disadvantages.
Sole Proprietorships
A proprietorship is typically defined as an unincorporated business owned by a single person. The process of
forming a business as asole proprietoris usually a simple matter. A business owner merely decides to begin
conducting business operations, and that person is immediately off and running. Compared to other forms of
business organizations, proprietorships have the following four important advantages:
1.They have a basic structure and are simple and inexpensive to form.
1Aaron Krupkin and Adam Looney. “9 Facts about Pass-Through Businesses.” Brookings. The Brookings Institution, May 15, 2017.
https://www.brookings.edu/research/9-facts-about-pass-through-businesses
402 • Corporate Structure and Governance
Access for free at openstax.org

2.They are subject to relatively few government rules and regulations.
3.Taxation on sole proprietorships is far simpler than on other organizational forms. There are no separate
taxes associated with a sole proprietorship, as there are with corporations. Sole proprietors simply report
all their business income and losses on their personal income tax returns.
4.Controlling responsibilities of the firm are not divided in any way. This results in less complicated
managerial decisions and improved timeliness of necessary corrective actions.
However, despite the ease of their formation and these stated advantages, proprietorships have four notable
shortcomings:
1.A sole proprietor has unlimited personal liability for any financial obligations or business debts, so in the
end, they risk incurring greater financial losses than the total amount of money they originally invested in
the company’s formation. As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of
$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering
this business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the
sole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance
coverage the business might have).
2.Unlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,
if the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additionalinvestor(s) might demand a
change in the organizational structure of the business.
3.Because of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of
financing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small
businesses.
4.A sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as
finance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs
associated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.
It is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into
corporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to
outweigh the advantages.
Partnerships
Apartnershipis a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who
decide to do business as an organization together. In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole
proprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.
Partnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners
may have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to
superior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital
to a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.
A partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the
partners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income
tax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,
which means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of
the firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.
For this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing
potential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the
company. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to
raise large amounts of capital.
2.1 • Business Structures41

Corporations
The most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a
legal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly
from its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that
limits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can
lose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the
company.
Unlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to
transfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.
These factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.
Many companies, such asMicrosoftandHewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,
but at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in
size and complexity.
An important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United
States are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;
then, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income toshareholders (stockholders), those
earnings are taxed again as personal income.
It is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created theS
corporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were
proprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S
corporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for
relatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is
often referred to as aC corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This
structure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow
and they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually
become C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller
businesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger
companies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.
Hybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships
Another form of business organization is thelimited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business
structure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially ahybrid form of business
that has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is
something called alimited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in
use. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in
such fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of
businesses.
Similar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability
protection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general
partner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct
proportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment.
A particular advantage of a limited liability partnership is that it allows some of the partners in a firm to limit
their liability. Under such a structure, only designated partners have unlimited liability for company debts;
other partners can be designated as limited partners, only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution.
Limited partners are typically not active decision makers within the firm.
Some important differences between LLCs and LLPs are highlighted inTable 2.1.

Table2.1Advantages and Disadvantages of LLCs and LLPs
LLCs and LLPs have gained great popularity in recent years, but larger companies still find substantial
advantages in being structured as C corporations. This is primarily due to the benefits of raising capital to
support long-term growth. It is interesting to note that LLC and LLP organizational structures were essentially
devised by attorneys. They generally are rather complicated, and the legal protection offered to their
ownership principals may vary from state to state. For these reasons, it is usually necessary to retain a
knowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.
Obviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages
and disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a
corporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of
funding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such
organizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than
relatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations. This follows from the
idea that limited ownership liability reduces the overall risks borne by investors. All other things being equal,
the lower a firm’s risk, the higher its value.
Growth opportunities will also have a tremendous impact on the overall value of a business. Because
corporations can raise financing more easily than most other types of organizations, they are better able to
engage in profitable projects, make investments, and otherwise take superior advantage of their many
favorable growth opportunities.
The value of any asset will, to a large degree, depend on its liquidity.Liquidityrefers to asset characteristics
that enable the asset to be sold or otherwise converted into cash in a relatively short period of time and with
minimal effort to attain fair market value for the owner. Because ownership of corporate stock is far easier to
transfer to a potential buyer than is any interest in a business proprietorship or partnership, and because
most investors are more willing to invest their funds in stocks than they are in partnerships that may carry
unlimited liability, an investment in corporate stock will remain relatively liquid. This, too, is an advantage of a
corporation and is another factor that enhances its value.

Amazon
Most people are surprised to learn thanAmazon, the largest online retailer, is set up as an LLC.

Amazon.com Services LLC is set up as a subsidiary of the larger Amazon.com Inc. Take a look at theAmazon
LLC company profile provided by Dun & Bradstreet(https://openstax.org/r/company-profiles-amazon).
Why do you think such a large corporation is set up as an LLC?
Incorporating a Business
Many business owners decide to structure their business as a corporation. In order to begin the process of
incorporation, an organization must file a business registration form with the US state in which it will be based
and carry on its primary business activities. The document that must be used for this application is generally
referred to as thearticles of incorporationor acorporate charter. Articles of incorporation are the single
most important governing documents of a corporation. The registration allows the state to collect taxes and
ensure that the business is complying with all applicable state laws.
The exact form of the articles of incorporation differs depending on the type of corporation. Some types of
articles of incorporation include the following:
•Domestic corporation(in state)
•Foreign corporation(out of state or out of country)
•Close (closely held) corporation
•Professional corporation
•Nonprofit corporation(several different types of nonprofits)
•Stock corporation
•Non-stock corporation
•Public benefit corporation
It is important to note that articles of incorporation are only required to establish a regular corporation.
Limited liability corporations require what are referred to asarticles of organization(or similar documents) to
register their business with a state. Some types of limited partnerships must also register with their state.
However, sole proprietorships do not have to register; for this reason, they are often the preferred
organizational structure for a person who is just starting out in business, at least initially.
Articles of incorporation provide the basic information needed to legally form the company and register the
business in its state. The state will need to know the name of the business, its purpose, and the people who
will be in charge of running it (theboard of directors). The state also needs to know about any stock that the
business will be selling to the public. The websites of varioussecretaries of statewill have information on the
different types of articles of incorporation, the requirements, and the filing process.

Stakeholders
Astakeholderis any person or group that has an interest in the outcomes of an organization’s actions.
Stakeholders include employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities, and governments.
Different stakeholders have different priorities, and companies often have to make compromises to please as
many stakeholders as possible.

Shareholders’ Roles and Composition
A shareholder or stockholder can be a person, company, or organization that holds stock in a given company.
Shareholders typically receive dividends if the company does well and succeeds. They are entitled to vote on
certain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a
shareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations
or debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,
deciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the
company’s financial statements.
Types of Shareholders
There are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common
shareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock. They have the right to control how the
company is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that
could potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company’s preferred stock
and have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of
annual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid. Though both common shareholders
and preferred shareholders see their stock value increase with the positive performance of the company,
common shareholders experience higher capital gains and losses.
Shareholders and directors are two different entities, although a director can also be shareholder. The
shareholder, as already mentioned, is a part owner of the company. A director, on the other hand, is the
person hired by the shareholders to perform oversight and provide strategic policy direction to company
management.
The Differences between a Shareholder and a Stakeholder
The termsshareholderandstakeholdermean different things. A shareholder is an owner of a company
because of the shares of stock they own. Stakeholders may not own part of the company, but they are in many
ways equally dependent on the performance of the company. However, their concerns may not be financial.
For example, a chain of hotels in the United States that employs thousands of people has several classes of
stakeholders, including employees who rely on the company for their jobs and local and national governments
that depend on the taxes the company pays.
Before a company becomes public, it is a private company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of
people calledsubscribers. Asubscriberis a member of the company whose name is listed in the
memorandum of association. Even when the company goes public or they depart from the company,
subscribers’ names continue to be written in the public register.
Role of Management
Corporations are run at the highest level by a group of senior managers referred to as the board of directors
(BOD). The BOD is ultimately responsible for providing oversight and strategic direction as well as overall
supervision of the organization at its highest managerial level. From an operational standpoint, the practical
day-to-day management of a company comprises of a team of several mid-level managers, who are
responsible for providing leadership to various departments in the company. Such managers may often have
different functional roles in a business organization. The primary roles of any management group involve
setting the objectives of the company; organizing operations; hiring, leading, and motivating employees; and
overseeing operations to ensure that company goals are continually being met.
It is also important that managers have a long-term focus on meeting growth targets and corporate
objectives. Unfortunately, there have been many examples of companies where the managerial focus was
shifted to short-term goals—quarterly or fiscal year earnings estimates or the current price of the company
stock—for personal reasons, such as increased bonuses and financial benefits. Such short-term thinking is

often not in the best interest of the long-term health and objectives of companies or their shareholders.

•Define an independent board member.
•Compare arguments for and against having independent board members.
•Describe ways boards can become diverse.
Functions of a Board of Directors
A board of directors is a group of people who are elected to represent shareholders, and these directors are
then ultimately responsible for running the company. Every public company is legally required to install a
board of directors. Nonprofit organizations and many private companies often establish a board of directors
as well, even if they are not legally required to do so.
The board is responsible for protecting shareholders’ interests, establishing management policies, overseeing
the corporation or organization, and making decisions about important issues. The board of directors acts as a
fiduciary for shareholders. The board is also tasked with a number of other responsibilities, including setting
company goals, creating dividend and stock option policies, hiring and firing chief executive officers (CEOs),
and ensuring that the company has the resources it needs to perform well.
Basic Structure of a Board of Directors
The bylaws of a company or organization determine the structure, responsibilities, and powers given to a
board of directors. The bylaws also determine how many board members there are, how the members are
elected, and how frequently the board members meet.
The board must represent shareholder and management interests, so it is best for the board to include both
internal and external members. Usually, there is an internal director and an external director. The internal
director is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the
interests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who
function outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.

International Structure of a Board of Directors
The structure of a board of directors varies more outside of the United States. In Asia and the European Union,
there are commonly executive and supervisory boards. The executive board is made up of company insiders
who are elected by employees and shareholders. In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company
CEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a
typical US board of directors. The chair of the board varies, but the board is always led by someone other than
the prominent executive officer.
Oversight: Corporate Governance
Corporate governanceis a discipline that focuses on how a company conducts its business and the various
controls that are implemented to ensure proper procedures and ethical behavior.
Although many companies and managers do operate with a fair and honest philosophy, others will try to
exploit the temporary benefits of actions that fall outside ethical behavior. Companies do not always adhere to
laws. You may have seen or read news stories about false reporting of earnings, failure to reveal financial
information, or payments of large bonuses to top executives shortly after a company files for bankruptcy.
In one infamous example, the insurance giantAIGpaid for a lavish trip to California for top employees of the
company immediately after declaring that the company was insolvent. It asked for and received financial
support from the US government in the bailout of 2008.
2
At other times, a company may cross the line between legal and illegal and violate the law in order to increase
profits. Because of the potential for human self-interest and greed, governments have enacted laws and
regulations that require specific actions of a company or restrict its activities in an effort to ensure fair
competition and ethical behavior.
Often, Congress enacts laws and regulations in response to major economic or other highly visible events.
Following the great market crash of 1929, the US government created a new set of rules and regulations
governing the issuing and trading of securities, theSecurities Act of 1933and theSecurities Exchange Act of
1934. The government also created theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC)to oversee these laws
and regulations.
The new laws required that firms make available specific financial information to current owners and
prospective owners and that the SEC approve the initial sale of securities to the public. More recently,
following a series of major ethical lapses at some firms, the US government enacted new legislation in 2002.
One of the most sweeping acts is theSarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires, among other things, the
following:
•That theCEOandchief financial officer (CFO)must attest to the fairness and accuracy of the company’s
financial reporting
•That the company implements and maintains an effective structure of internal controls responsible for the
reporting of financial results
•That the company and an external public accounting firm confirm the effectiveness of the controls over
the most recent fiscal year
In addition, SOX created thePublic Company Accounting Oversight Board, outlining the prohibited activities of
auditors. It also set a requirement that the SEC issue new rulings that establish compliance with the act.
Board of Directors Oversight and Corporate Governance

boards of directors of public companies and financial institutions have been directed to improve oversight and

corporate governance. Boards are evolving from focusing primarily on the needs of top key individuals to
considering broader aspects of ethics, values, and corporate culture. Boards now oversee the monitoring
systems being put in place and may take on direct responsibilities related to senior management.
The Role of the Audit Committee
A strong independentaudit committee (AC)is an important part of the corporate governance efforts of any
firm. The AC is formed by the board of directors as a separately chartered subcommittee of the board of
directors. It reports regularly to the BOD and assists the board by assuming responsibilities for critical
corporate financial matters, such as reviewing audit plans and findings, approving external public accountants,
and coordinating the efforts of both internal and external financial reviews and audits. The audit committee
provides expertise in all financial and accounting matters for a company, and it is therefore a critical part of a
company’s corporate governance efforts.
Some important functions of the audit committee include
•confirming the accuracy of the firm’s financial reporting;
•verifying that systems of internal control and risk management are operating effectively;
•ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;
•verifying the qualifications, independence, and performance of the external public auditing firm; and
•coordinating the activities and performance of the internal audit function.
The role of the audit committee has significantly expanded over the years, and it has become exceedingly
important with the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Due to this increase in importance and recognition,
several boards have shifted some of the audit committee’s responsibilities to separately chartered committees
in order to create a balance of duties and ensure that those duties are effectively focused on and efficiently
executed. Some of these additional committees have been known to include a compensation committee, a
disclosure committee, and a governance committee, and they all have related objectives that need to be
documented within the charter of each of the individual committees. It is important for the different
committees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its
responsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.
The audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization’s corporate governance process
and to communicate any recommendations for changes. The audit committee will usually follow up and
monitor the process put in place to implement any changes or necessary improvements. As with any other
corporate function, the audit committee’s role is greatly affected by the legal, institutional, financial, cultural,
and political circumstances that impact the company.
Importance of Improving Oversight and Governance
It is crucial to today’s corporate environment that firms do not lose sight of achieving and maintaining strong
and efficient oversight and governance. This is true despite the litany of other important items on the busy
agendas of most boards.
Keeping a focus on the critical ethics of management, as well as the traditional focus on the importance of
ethics to the overall organization, is not only timely in this day and age but also sound business practice. The
importance of establishing a comprehensive system of checks and balances cannot be overemphasized.
Beginning with the chief executive officer, these checks and balances need to progress through senior
management, and they ultimately include the board of directors itself. Similar checks and balances need to
then filter down though the rest of the entire firm. By taking the appropriate steps to improve corporate
oversight and governance, overall business risk can be mitigated and future operational problems reduced.
Additionally, such steps can lead to the positive effects of achieving sustainable operational and financial
benefits for a company and its shareholders.

PepsiCois a global leader in the food and beverage industry. It has also been noted for its excellence in
corporate governance. Take a look at thePepsiCo website(https://openstax.org/r/pepsico). Why do you

Companieslist for 2021?
The Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors
An independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company
other than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the
company for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on
information provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best
practice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held
companies.
In most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result inconflicts
of interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a
partnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such
an instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear
that it would lead to potential conflict.
A board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which
•helps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of
shareholders;
•allows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits
situations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and
•enables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other
self-profiting motives.
The Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors
As mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors. Increasingly over recent
years, corporate management has begun to appreciate the value of diversity in boards of directors. This has
resulted in a significant increase in the total number of women and people of color in boardrooms in the
United States. However, many business observers believe that corporate governance practices have a long
way to go in this respect. Increasing representation has now grown to become a high priority for most
businesses and organizations around the world.
Board members face many challenges in making decisions effectively and efficiently as possible. Because of
such challenges, the potential objective of diversifying the boardroom competes with other worthy topics and
objectives such as improving cybersecurity, advancing customer service, identifying and reducing risk,
improving community relations, and positioning strategically within an industry. This has left corporate
governance experts and researchers in a situation where they find themselves “playing catch-up” to
adequately diversify.

Agency Problems and Issues
Agency problemsrefers to conflicts that occur when anagent(manager) who is entrusted with following the
interests of theprincipal(shareholder or owner) of an organization abuses their position to further their own
personal goals. In the field of corporate finance, agency problems are often related to a conflict of interest
between the management of a company and its shareholders.
For many years, this has been a very common problem that has been seen in nearly every kind of organization,
irrespective of it being a church, a club, a not-for-profit organization, a multinational corporation, or any other
government agency or institution. As with most problematic issues in business, agency problems can be
resolved, but only if organizations are willing to take the appropriate steps to resolve them.
Every company has its own set of goals and objectives, but it is important to note that the employee and
personal goals of managers may differ and may not align with the goals and objectives of stockholders
(ownership). Because these differences exist, and because all parties have a desire to maximize their own
wealth, agency problems can often arise, having a negative impact on company profits, stock price, and the
goodwill of the shareholder base.
There are three primary types of agency problems, discussed below.
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Example of an Agency Problem
ABC Co. used to sell organic shampoo for $15, but the stockholders of ABC lobbied for an increase in the
selling price of the shampoo from $15 to $18. This was to increase earnings and, ultimately, their own
personal wealth through an uptick in stock price. However, as a result of this unnecessary rise in the price
of the shampoo, customers were disappointed, and a majority of them wound up boycotting the product.
Additionally, some of the consumers who continued to purchase the product noticed a decline in the overall
quality of the shampoo and were also very disappointed. In this scenario, agency problems surfaced
between stockholders and loyal customers of the company.
Stockholders versus Management
Large corporations typically have a substantial number of stockholders forming their ownership. It is essential
for an organization to separate the management of a company from this ownership in order to avoid this type
ofagency problem.
Segregating ownership from management can be advantageous for an organization. Doing so will usually not
have any effects on normal business operations. At the same time, the company can employ different experts
and professionals to manage key operations of the business.
However, a drawback to this is that hiring outsiders may eventually become troublesome for shareholders.
External managers who are brought into a company may end up making self-serving decisions or even
502 • Corporate Structure and Governance

misusing company funds. This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share
prices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.
An example of an agency problem between management and shareholders occurred at WorldCom in 2001,
when their CEO used company assets to underwrite several personal loans.
3
As a result of these inappropriate
actions, the company took on additional debt that negatively impacted WorldCom’s capital structure, liquidity,
and ultimately its stock price. From this example, we can see how individual greed on the part of agents,
executives, or corporate management can lead to significant agency problems.
Investors versus Creditors
If a company decides to engage in risky investments and projects in order to drive organizational profitability,
these increased risk levels could threaten the company’s ability to service (repay) their debts, leading to
possible default.
This additional risk could also result in creditors taking steps to devalue such debts, which in most cases refers
to company bond issues. In the end, if these riskier projects end up failing and the company loses money,
investors (bondholders) may also experience financial risk as bonds go into default or otherwise lose market
value. This then becomes a potential agency problem between bondholders (investors) and creditors.
Stockholders versus Other Stakeholders
Situations may arise in which stockholders of a firm find themselves in conflicts of interest with other
stakeholders of the company. For example, employees of a firm might be asking for a general wage increase.
If such a wage increase were voted down by stockholders, this could result in key employees departing the
organization, eventually leading to poorer business results and the dissatisfaction of other stakeholders in the
company as company profits decline. In such an example, we see the agency problem of stockholders versus
other stakeholders.
A more specific example of such an agency problem occurred in 2011, when Oregon-based food and gift
basket company Harry & David was forced to file for bankruptcy.
4
This was a direct result of the company
being purchased through a leveraged buyout that left the company saddled with a tremendous amount of
debt. However, the most important factor leading to the company’s failure was the actions of Steven Heyer,
who was a friend of the new owners and had been hired as CEO. Heyer, who was awarded an exorbitant
executive salary, was also allowed to sink the company into further debt. Harry & David has since emerged
from bankruptcy under new leadership. But this example should serve as a cautionary tale of what can happen
when stockholders are able to put their interests ahead of those of other stakeholders in a corporate
environment.

Enron is one particularly infamous example of an agency problem. Enron’s directors were responsible for

dollar company, Enron began losing money in 1997. It had also started incurring a tremendous amount of
debt. Fearing a drop in stock prices, Enron’s management team tried to disguise the problems by
misrepresenting them through inappropriate accounting methods, which resulted in confusing and
misleading financial statements.
Disaster started to unfold in 2001, when common stock prices fell from $90 to under $1 per share. The
company filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, and criminal charges were brought against several key
Enron employees, including former CEO Kenneth Lay and former CFO Andrew Fastow. Jeffrey Skilling was
subsequently named CEO in February 2001, but he ended up resigning six months later.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC
Ponzi schemes are common examples of the agency problem.Agency theoryclaims that a lack of
oversight and incentive alignment greatly contributes to these problems. Many investors fall into Ponzi
schemes thinking that taking fund management outside a traditional banking institution reduces fees and
saves money.
Even though established financial institutions reduce risk by providing oversight and enforcing legal
practices, some Ponzi schemes simply involve taking advantage of consumer suspicions about the banking
industry and financial markets. In this type of environment, the consumer cannot ensure that an agent is
acting in their best interest. Investments are made under limited or, in many cases, completely nonexistent
oversight.
Bernie Madoff’s scam is probably one of the most infamous examples of a Ponzi scheme. Madoff’s fraud
started with friends, relatives, and acquaintances in New York, but it ultimately grew to encompass major
charities such as Hadassah, universities such as Tufts and Yeshiva, institutional investors, and wealthy
families in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The cash losses of Madoff’s scheme were recently estimated to
be between $17 billion and $20 billion. The returns he promised were higher than what most investment
firms and banks were offering—so promising that almost all of his investors ignored any concerns they may
have had and basically looked the other way. Madoff paid for any redemption requests with money that
had been newly invested.
Madoff’sPonzi schemefell apart when he could no longer pay his investors. He was criminally charged,
convicted, and given a 150-year prison sentence. Madoff died in April 2021 while serving his prison term.

How to Resolve Agency Problems
Ultimately, agency problems result from the differences among the interests of a company’s management,
other stakeholders of the firm, and its ownership or stockholders. When perpetuated, these differences may
eventually result in lasting conflicts of interest. In order for companies to avoid such problems, it is imperative
that they address the underlying problems of these differences. This will help ensure that normal business
operations are not being adversely impacted by the agency problem.
While there is no surefire way to resolve all conflicts of interest and agency problems, some measures that can
522 • Corporate Structure and Governance
Access for free at openstax.org

help mitigate such issues include the following:
•Offering incentives to management for strong performance and ethical behavior
•Awarding decision makers with stock packages, commissions, and other long-term compensation
packages to encourage long-term thinking and matching of company objectives with shareholders’
priorities
•Penalizing poor performance, shortsightedness, and unethical behavior
The prevailing belief in agency theory is that when a business creates organizational incentives that encourage
hard work on projects that will benefit the company in both the short and long term, more employees will be
encouraged to act in the business’s best interest.
Another means of resolving agency problems is through a hostile takeover of the organization. Even the threat
of such a takeover may be effective in reducing or eliminating these conflicts of interest. A hostile corporate
takeover tends to unify and discipline a management or agent group, thus fostering a union of agent and
shareholder interests. When such a potential threat or outright ownership change is introduced to a company,
its managers are more likely to act in the best long-term interests of the shareholders in order to maintain
their leadership positions within the company.
By better aligningagent(management) andprincipal(ownership) goals, agency theory attempts to bridge any
gulfs among employees, employers, and stakeholders that are created by the principal-agent problem. While it
is recognized as being nearly impossible for companies to eliminate the ongoing agency problem, it is also
recognized that it is possible to minimize its negative effects.
Impact of ESG Ratings
In recent years, many publicly traded companies, as well as many that are privately owned, are being
evaluated and rated according to environmental, social, and governance(ESG)factors. These ratings and
evaluations are primarily conducted by third-party organizations. As a result, the investment community is
using these reports and ratings to an ever-increasing degree in order to measure and assess corporate ESG
factors and performance.
Environmental, social, and governance issues have become an important part of the investment community’s
evaluation of publicly traded companies. Each component of what is now referred to as ESG has equal
importance in ongoing corporate evaluations, as perFigure 2.3below. It is critical for the senior management
of any corporation to stay abreast of any and all ESG issues as they arise and take immediate corrective action
when necessary.
Figure2.3Importance of ESG Factors to a Business Concern
ESG measurements and assessments have become very important to firms, as they often become the basis of
formal and informal buy recommendations by investment professionals. ESG ratings were originally developed
to assist in determining the general risk of ESG factors for any public company, but they have since grown to
become unique scores used by investors to gauge the potential attractiveness of investment in the subject
company. Because of the nature of these factors, firms that are rated with high ESG metrics are believed to
2.4 • Agency Issues: Shareholders and Corporate Boards53

represent superior investments and to have proactive management teams focused on creating long-term
value of company stock.
Thus, with investors increasingly using ESG scores to form their investment strategies, the consequences of a
poor rating can have a negative impact on a firm’s share price and result in substantial problems. In any case,
it is important to note that ESG is only a starting point from which it is possible to gather indicators on a
business and its direction. In the end, it does not present the entire story of a firm. Any investment decisions
about the company in question should include a significant amount of additional data.
2.5Interacting with Investors, Intermediaries, and Other Market Participants
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define the investor relations function.
•Discuss how the investor relations office interacts with investors, regulators, and other corporate
stakeholders.
•Describe the topics most often discussed during a quarterly conference call.
•Explain how press release information impacts company stock prices.
Investor Relations
Within the general field of corporate public relations is a specific subdivision referred to asinvestor relations
(IR). IR involves elements of communication, marketing, and finance and is designed to control the flow of
information from the management of a public corporation to its investors and stakeholders.
Because the investment community plays such a critical role in the overall growth and success of any
corporation, it is imperative that firms maintain strong and open relationships with their shareholder or
potential investor audience. IR was developed to take responsibility for achieving and maintaining these
crucial relationships.
Investor relations are quite different from typical public relations practices. A firm’s IR group must work very
closely with the accounting and legal departments, as well as with members of the senior management team,
such as the CEO and CFO.
As might be expected, IR has far more regulatory obligations than standard public relations functions, largely
due to corporate reporting requirements enforced by the SEC and theInternational Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). IR became significantly more important in 2002, when the United States Congress passed
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), also known as the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection
Act. This legislation resulted in requirements that dramatically increased the extent of financial reporting for
any publicly traded company. SOX was enacted in an attempt to prevent the occurrence of corporate financial
scandals such as the one notoriously committed by the Enron Corporation that we discussed earlier.
In summary, investor relations functions have responsibilities including, but not limited to,
•coordinating live shareholder meetings and press conferences;
•disseminating financial information to the investment community;
•conducting briefings to the financial analyst community;
•publishing thequarterlyreportandannual report; and
•addressing any issues that arise as a result of financial disclosure.
The best time to form an internal IR function or to engage an IR firm is when a company begins the process of
becoming publicly traded through an initial public offering, or IPO.
Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls
As a result of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, all publicly traded companies are required to file certain
542 • Corporate Structure and Governance
Access for free at openstax.org

financial reports with the SEC. The underlying purpose of these requirements is to provide shareholders and
the investment community with important operational and financial information on a regular basis and in a
transparent manner. Reports filed with the SEC include the annualForm 10-K, quarterly Form 10-Qs, and
current periodic Form 8-Ks, in addition to proxy reports and certain shareholder and affiliate reporting
documents. Quarterly 10-Qs are an ongoing and regular reporting requirement of publicly traded companies
and are to be filed within 45 days following the end of each fiscal quarter.
Depending on a company’s size and the complexity of its operation, a firm is likely to issue an earningspress
releaseand conduct aconference callwith the investment community within this same 45-day period. There
is no legal requirement for companies to do either of these things, but experts in IR view these
communications tools as best practice. They can add context and commentary to the reported financial
results.
It is important for companies to do their planning and not enter a quarterly earnings conference call
unprepared. There is a multitude of available resources for companies to analyze and review in preparation.
Among such resources are industry reports prepared by government agencies; the financial reports and
earnings calls of competing organizations, both within and outside of a company’s primary industry; and
financial research reports prepared by various covering analysts, who follow the specific company and are
employed by financial brokerage firms.
Investment Meetings and Conferences
Organizing theannual meetingof shareholders, investor roadshows, and investment conferences is no easy
task for any corporation, though all of these audience-facing events are critical to maintaining strong relations
with shareholders and the investment community. It is important to reach shareholders and investors on an
almost personal basis by crafting a successful and interesting investment story. For effective investor relations,
key messages supporting any ownership or potential investment case should be clear and consistent. These
key messages should be embedded within the company’s materials and should form the basis of
presentations, the corporate website, and annual reports. They should also be reinforced via concrete
examples during annual meetings, roadshows, and investor presentations.
Figure2.4Quarterly Investor Relations Presentation(credit: “MAPFRE” by Castilla y León Económica/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Corporations have found that using senior management’s time efficiently is also important to investor
relations. By targeting the ownership and potential investing audience, senior executives can make the best
use of their time and improve their interactions with the investing public during these events. If smaller
companies outsource the investor meeting planning process, the third-party firm should be thoroughly
grounded in the client’s corporate culture.
2.5 • Interacting with Investors, Intermediaries, and Other Market Participants55

The most productive investor and shareholder meetings begin with a strong, understandable corporate
introduction and continue by delivering an engaging story that demonstrates the company’s successes, a
track record of growth, and the high probability of favorable future prospects. Additionally, it is important for a
company’s senior management to end any meeting with feedback from the investor audience and set
timelines for follow-up. There will always be times when something unexpected may happen and the addition
of information or impromptu changes to scheduled agendas may occur. It is at times like these when
understanding the body language and facial expressions of an audience can be critical in producing a
favorable outcome of the meeting.
It is unlikely that the decision to invest or to remain an investor will be made based on a single corporate
event, but impressions, good or bad, will certainly factor into such decisions over a period of time. Thus, it is
important for IR officers to understand the importance of follow-up communication with their audience.
Purposes of Corporate Press Releases
Press releases have always been a vital tool in the communications toolkit of an IR professional. Various social
media channels are also becoming increasingly popular for delivering company information and news.
However, the press release remains a standard medium for most companies to communicate corporate news,
results, and ideas.
Press releases can be written with various intentions. Whether to release financial information, unveil new
products or services, announce changes in management, or a host of other reasons, all communications have
a different objective. Not all press releases are created equally, and they have varying degrees of effectiveness.
Any press release should contain information in easy-to-understand language that is free of corporate jargon
and as concise as possible. Press releases may be viewed by multiple audiences, such as customers,
stakeholders, investors, potential investors, and the general public, which is vital to consider when drafting a
press release.
According toPR Newswirestatistics, press releases that contain multimedia content have been known to
substantially increase press release views.
5
Using infographics and charts where possible and relaying the key
messages in short, easy-to-digest points make a press release easier for the reader to take in. Quotes from
senior management can provide valuable insight, but they should not provide any new information; they
should simply extend or expand on a subject already mentioned and further back up a claim.

Important Differences among Domestic, International, and Global Organizations
If a company becomes global or multinational in scope, fundamental analysis of the organization by the
investment community can become more complex. In order to better understand a company, it is important to
determine what laws affect the company’s governance process and which set of accounting rules is used to
fashion its financial reports.
Domestic companies operate completely or for the most part within the borders of the United States. While
such organizations may import raw materials and supplies from other nations or end up exporting their
finished products to other countries around the world, in the end, these international activities represent only
a very small portion of their overall business activities.
Domestic companies are typically governed by US accounting and securities laws that have been established
by the SEC. Further, financial reporting for these domestic organizations is to be completed usingGenerally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
International firms, while based in the United States, will typically maintain significant levels of international
investment and conduct operations that may be quite diverse, both geographically and culturally. For such
international firms, parent company accounting will usually adhere to GAAP standards. Conversely, non-US
subsidiaries of such international firms may be regulated by laws dictated by their host countries. These will
often differ significantly from those in the United States.
In recent years, accounting regulations in countries outside the United States have come under the jurisdiction
ofInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It should be noted that guidelines and regulations under
IFRS and those under GAAP can differ significantly. As a result of these regulatory differences, any specific
divergences in accounting or governance practices between foreign subsidiaries and a US parent company
should be clearly stated and disclosed in the parent company’s financial reports.
Global firms have substantial operations and investments in different countries (global markets), and they
may have no single center or basis of operational activity. In such cases, regulations for corporate governance
are usually determined by the laws of the country in which the parent company has been established. While
there are some global firms that report their financial statements according to GAAP standards, usually to
satisfy the informational needs of US investors, most global parent companies’ financials will adhere to IFRS
reporting standards.
Difference in Financial Reporting: GAAP versus IFRS
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) andInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)were
designed with similar objectives in mind: to provide a common and structured set of guidelines to assist in the
preparation of accurate and unbiased financial reporting for public corporations.
Yet despite these commonalities in purpose, there are important differences between them. Among these are
differences in inventory accounting and reporting, guidelines for consolidation of subsidiaries, and the
accounting and reporting of minority interests.

serves up 3,000 terabytes of data to the public annually, and accommodates 40,000 new filers per year on
average.

Summary
2.1Business Structures
The most common forms of business organizations are sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and
hybrids. There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of organization involving ease of formation, tax
requirements, and personal liabilities. The most common type of organization for larger businesses is the
corporation, the establishment of which involves filing articles of incorporation.
2.2Relationship between Shareholders and Company Management
A stakeholder is any individual or group that has an interest in the outcomes of an organization’s actions.
Shareholders are relevant to a corporation form of business because they own stock in the corporation. The
board of directors of a company is ultimately responsible to shareholders for effectively running the business.
2.3Role of the Board of Directors
The board of directors acts as a fiduciary for shareholders. The board is also tasked with a number of other
responsibilities, including setting company goals, creating dividend and stock option policies, hiring and firing
CEOs, and ensuring that the company has the resources it needs to perform well. Diversity and experience
play important roles in corporate governance and in the strength and effectiveness of a board of directors.
2.4Agency Issues: Shareholders and Corporate Boards
Issues and conflicts of interest might arise between shareholders (public ownership) and senior management,
including C-level executives and the board of directors. Although there is no definite way to resolve all conflicts
of interest, some measures that can help mitigate problems include offering incentives for strong
performance and ethical behavior and awarding decision makers with stock packages to encourage long-term
thinking.
2.5Interacting with Investors, Intermediaries, and Other Market Participants
Investor relations are important to a company’s overall corporate governance strategy. Effective
communication that is straightforward, open, and free of potentially confusing corporate jargon has become a
critical component of a company’s image, overall message, and long-term success.
2.6Companies in Domestic and Global Markets
Companies sometimes expand internationally, and there are advantages and disadvantages of such growth.
International or global expansion efforts require careful and efficient communication, planning, and financing.

American Airlinesis one of the largest airlines in the world, flying to 350 destinations in 50 countries.

The
managers of American Airlines are running a complex company. They have to be familiar with aeronautical
science, they have to know the laws and regulations impacting commercial air travel, and they must keep
abreast of global weather conditions. There is a lot to know about the airline industry itself.
However, operating a company such as American Airlines requires more than knowledge of the science and
technology of the industry. American Airlines does not operate in a vacuum. Like every company, it is impacted
by the economic environment in which it operates. American Airlines has to be familiar with how supply and
demand will impact fuel costs and other expenses. It must also be familiar with macroeconomic trends. During
periods of high unemployment, it may be difficult for the company to sell tickets to people wanting to travel to
vacation getaways. During periods of low unemployment, American Airlines may find it difficult to hire quality
workers at a wage rate it considers reasonable. Global economic conditions will also impact American Airlines;
as the economies of Europe expand rapidly, the euro will increase in value and impact the cost of items that
American Airlines purchases along its European routes.

their strategic plan.
3.1Microeconomics
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Identify equilibrium price and quantity.
•Discuss how changes in demand will impact equilibrium price and quantity.
•Discuss how changes in supply will impact equilibrium price and quantity.
Demand
Microeconomics focuses on the decisions and actions of individual agents, such as businesses or customers,
within the economy. The interactions of the decisions that businesses and customers make will determine the
price and quantity of a good or service that is sold in the marketplace. Financial managers need a strong
foundation inmicroeconomics. This foundation helps them understand the market for the company’s
products and services, including pricing considerations. Microeconomics also helps managers understand the
availability and prices of resources that are necessary for the company to create its products and services.
A successful business cannot just create and manufacture a product or provide a service; it must produce a
product or service that customers will purchase.Demandrefers to the quantity of a good or service that
consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given time period,ceteris paribus(a
Latin phrase meaning “all other things being equal”).
Let’s consider what the demand for pizza might look like. Suppose that at a price of $30 per pizza, no one will
purchase a pizza, but if the price of a pizza is $25, 10 people might buy a pizza. If the price falls even lower,
more pizzas will be purchased, as shown inTable 3.1.

The information inTable 3.1can be viewed in the form of a graph, as inFigure 3.2. Economists refer to the line
inFigure 3.2as ademand curve. When plotting a demand curve, price is placed on the vertical axis, and
quantity is placed on the horizontal axis. Because more pizzas are bought at lower prices than at higher prices,
this demand curve is downward sloping. This inverse relationship is referred to as thelaw of demand.

Figure3.2Demand Curve for Pizzas
The inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of a good sold occurs for two reasons.
First, as you consume more and more pizza, the amount of happiness that one more pizza will bring you
diminishes. If you have had nothing to eat all day and you are hungry, you might be more willing to pay a high
price for a pizza, and that pizza will bring you a great deal of satisfaction. However, after your hunger has been
somewhat satisfied, you may not be willing to pay as much for a second pizza. You may only be willing to
purchase a third pizza (to freeze at home) if you can get it at a fairly low price. Second, demand depends not
only on your willingness to pay but also on your ability to pay. If you have limited income, then as the price of
pizza rises, you simply cannot buy as much pizza.
The demand curve is drawn as a relationship between the price of the good and the quantity of the good
purchased. It isolates the relationship between price and quantity demand. A demand curve is drawn
assuming that no relevant factor besides the price of the product is changing. This assumption is, as
mentioned above, ceteris paribus.
If another relevant economic factor changes, the demand curve can change. Relevant economic factors would
include consumer income, the size of the population, the tastes and preferences of consumers, and the price
of other goods. For example, if the price of hamburgers doubled, then families might substitute having a pizza
night for having a hamburger cookout. This would cause the demand for pizzas to increase.
If the demand for pizzas increased, the quantities of pizza purchased at every price level would be higher. The
demand schedule for pizzas might look likeTable 3.2after an increase in the price of hamburgers.

This change leads to a movement in the demand curve—outward to the right, as shown inFigure 3.3. This is
known as an increase in demand. Now, at a price of $25, people will purchase 19 pizzas instead of 10; and at a
price of $15, people will purchase 39 pizzas instead of 30.
Figure3.3An Increase in Demand Represented as a Movement of the Demand Curve to the Right
A decrease in demand would cause the demand curve to move to the left. This could happen if people’s tastes
and preferences changed. If there were, for example, increased publicity about pizza being an unhealthy food
choice, some individuals would choose healthier alternatives and consume less pizza.

Demand Curve Shifts
If any of the items that are assumed not to change when a demand curve is drawn do change, then the
demand curve can shift. To learn more about these changes in demand, watch theMRU video on demand
curve shifts(https://openstax.org/r/mru-video).
Supply
Supplyis the quantity of a good or service that firms are willing to sell at various prices, during a given time
period, ceteris paribus.Table 3.3is a fictional example of a supply schedule for pizzas. In some cases, higher
prices encourage producers to provide more of their product for sale. Thus, there is a positive relationship
between the price and quantity supplied.

The data from the supply schedule can be pictured in a graph, as is shown inFigure 3.4. Because a higher price
encourages suppliers to sell more pizzas, thesupply curvewill be upward sloping.
Figure3.4Supply Curve for Pizzas
The supply curve isolates the relationship between the price of pizzas and the quantity of pizzas supplied. All
other relevant economic factors are assumed to remain unchanged when the curve is drawn. If a factor such
as the cost of cheese or the salaries paid to workers changes, then the supply curve will move. A shift to the
right indicates that a greater quantity of pizzas will be provided by firms at a particular price; this would
indicate an increase in supply. A decrease in supply would be represented by a shift in the supply curve to the
left.
LINK TO LEARNING
Supply Curve Shifts
The ceteris paribus assumption is made when drawing a supply curve, just as it is when drawing a demand
curve. If a relevant economic variable other than the price of the good for which the supply curve is drawn
changes, the supply curve will shift. For more information about how changes in these variables will move
the supply curve, watch theMRU video on supply curve shifts(https://openstax.org/r/mru-video-on-
supply).
Equilibrium Price
Demand represents buyers, and supply represents sellers. In the market, these two groups interact to
determine the price of a good and the quantity of the good that is sold. Because both the demand curve and
the supply curve are graphed with price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, these two
curves can be placed in the same graph, as is shown inFigure 3.5.
3.1 • Microeconomics71

Figure3.5Graph of Demand and Supply Showing Equilibrium Price and Quantity
The point at which the supply and demand curves intersect is known as theequilibrium. At theequilibrium
price, the quantity demanded will equal exactly the quantity supplied. There is no shortage or surplus of the
product. In the example shown inFigure 3.5, when the price is $15, consumers want to purchase 30 pizzas and
sellers want to make 30 pizzas available for purchase. The market is in balance.
A price higher than the equilibrium price will not be sustainable in a competitive marketplace. If the price of a
pizza were $20, suppliers would make 40 pizzas available, but the quantity of pizzas demanded would be only
20 pizzas. This would be a surplus, or excess quantity supplied, of pizzas. Restaurant owners who see that they
have 40 pizzas to sell but can only sell 20 of those pizzas will lower their prices to encourage more customers
to purchase pizzas. At the same time, the restaurant owners will cut back on their pizza production. This
process will drive the pizza price down from $20 toward the equilibrium price.
The opposite would occur if the price of a pizza were only $5. Customers may want to purchase 50 pizzas, but
restaurants would only want to sell 10 pizzas at the low price. Quantity demanded would exceed quantity
supplied. At a price below the equilibrium price, a shortage would occur. Shortages drive prices up toward the
equilibrium price.

Table3.4Demand and Supply Schedules for Sweatshirts
Solution:
The demand curve for sweatshirts is the downward-sloping curve inFigure 3.6, showing the inverse
relationship between price and quantity demanded. The upward-sloping curve is the supply curve for
sweatshirts. The equilibrium price will be $30. At a price of $30, the quantity demanded of 20 sweatshirts
equals the quantity supplied of 20 sweatshirts.
Figure3.6Graph of Demand and Supply for Sweatshirts
Changes in Equilibrium Price
A price that is either too high (above the equilibrium price) or too low (below the equilibrium price) is not
sustainable in a competitive market. Market forces pull prices to the equilibrium, where they stay until either
supply or demand changes.
If supply increases and the curve moves outward to the right, as inFigure 3.7, then the equilibrium price will
fall. With the original supply curve, Supply

, the equilibrium price was $15; quantity demanded and quantity
supplied were both 30 pizzas at that price. If a new pizza restaurant opens, increasing the supply of pizzas to

Supply

, the equilibrium will move from Equilibrium

to Equilibrium
2
. The new equilibrium price will
be $10. This new equilibrium is associated with a quantity demanded of 40 pizzas and a quantity supplied of 40
pizzas.
Figure3.7Supply Curve Changes When Supply IncreasesAn increase in supply leads to a lower equilibrium price and an increase
in quantity demanded.
It is important to note that the demand curve inFigure 3.7does not move. In other words, demand does not
change. As the equilibrium price falls, consumers move along the demand curve to a point with a combination
of a lower price and a higher quantity. Economists call this movement anincrease in quantity demanded.
Distinguishing between an increase in quantity demanded (a movement along the demand curve) and an
increase in demand (a shift in the demand curve) is critical when analyzing market equilibriums.
Equilibrium price will also fall if demand falls. Remember that a decrease in demand is represented as a shift
of the demand curve inward to the left. InFigure 3.8, you can see how a decrease in demand causes a change
fromto.
Figure3.8A Decrease in Demand
At the new equilibrium,, the price of a pizza is $10. The new equilibrium quantity is 20 pizzas. Note that the
supply curve has not moved. Producers moved along their supply curve, producing fewer pizzas as the price
dropped; this is known as adecrease in quantity supplied.

Has the demand for sweatshirts increased or decreased? Show this movement in a graph. What happens to
the equilibrium? What are some reasons you can think of that may have caused this change in demand?
Solution:
This is an increase in demand. At every price, consumers now want to purchase more sweatshirts than they
did before. This is shown in the graph as a movement of the demand curve outward to the right. Both the
equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will rise because of this increase in demand. The equilibrium
price will now be $40, and the equilibrium quantity of sweatshirts will be 30. Note that there is not an
increase in supply; the supply curve does not move. There is simply an increase in quantity supplied (see
Figure 3.9).
3.1 • Microeconomics75

Figure3.9Graph Showing Increase in Sweatshirt Supply
A change in any of the factors that are assumed to be held constant under the ceteris paribus assumption
could have caused the demand curve to shift to the right. Perhaps a rise in consumers’ incomes led them to
purchase more clothing, including sweatshirts. Or an unseasonably cool fall could result in more people
purchasing sweatshirts. If a popular TV personality indicates that their favorite weekend wardrobe consists
of jeans and a sweatshirt and the tabloids run pictures of the celebrity wearing sweatshirts, the tastes and
preferences of consumers may change. Another possibility is that the price of sweaters may have risen,
causing people to substitute sweatshirts for sweaters.
3.2Macroeconomics
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define inflation and describe historical trends in inflation.
•Define unemployment and describe how unemployment is measured.
•Define gross domestic product and describe historical trends in gross domestic product.
Inflation
Macroeconomicslooks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,
unemployment, and growth of production. When the managers of an automotive company look at the market
for steel and how the price of steel impacts the company’s production costs, they are looking at a
microeconomic issue. Rather than being concerned about individual markets or products, macroeconomics is
the branch of economic theory that considers the overall environment in which businesses operate.
Perhaps you have heard your parents talk about how much they paid for their first automobile. Or maybe you
have heard your grandparents reminisce about spending a quarter to purchase a Coke. These conversations
often turn to a discussion of how a dollar just doesn’t go as far as it used to. The reason for this isinflation, or
a general increase in price levels.
It is not that just the price of an automobile has increased or that the price of a Coke has increased. Over time,
the prices of many other things, from the salt on your table to college tuition, have increased. Also, you were
paid a higher hourly wage at your first job than your parents and grandparents were paid; the price of labor
has risen.
When economists talk about inflation, they are discussing this phenomenon of the price of many things rising.
Instead of tracking the price of one particular item, they consider the price of purchasing a basket of goods.

Inflation means that the purchasing power of currency falls. Whenever there is inflation, a $100 bill will not
purchase as much as it did before.

CPI Inflation Calculator
According to the USBureau of Labor Statistics, $100 in January 1913 had the same purchasing power as
$1,722.45 in January 2000 and $2,699.20 in January 2021. If you would like to compare the purchasing power
of a dollar amount in two different time periods, you can use theCPI Inflation Calculator
(https://openstax.org/r/cpi-inflation-calculator). You can enter a current dollar amount and calculate its
value in an earlier period. Alternatively, you can calculate the current value of dollar amounts from years
ago.
How Is Inflation Measured
Each month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects price data and publishes measures of inflation.
The measure most commonly cited is theconsumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on the cost of buying
a fixed basket of goods and services comprising items a typical urban family of four might purchase. The BLS
divides these purchases into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation,
medical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.
Sometimes you will hear acore inflation indexbeing quoted. This index is calculated by excluding volatile
economic variables, such as energy and food prices, from the CPI measure. Energy and food prices can jump
around from month to month because of weather or other short-lived events. A drought can cause food prices
to spike; a temporary rise in gasoline prices can occur as a hurricane approaches the coastline. These types of
shocks are transitory in nature and do not represent underlying economic conditions.
While the CPI and the core inflation index are based on the prices that households pay, theproducer price
index (PPI)is based on prices that producers of goods and services pay for their supplies and raw materials.
The PPI captures price changes that occur prior to the retail level. Because it indicates rising costs to
producers, increases in the PPI can foreshadow increases in the CPI.
Both the CPI and the PPI are calculated by the BLS. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a
measure of inflation known as theGDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,
deflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed
basket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the
components of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the
GDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.
LINK TO LEARNING
The Billion Prices Project
Although the concept of inflation as a rise in the general price level is simple, measuring and documenting
this increase is complicated. The CPI is designed to measure the cost of a market basket of goods that a
typical urban family purchases. But what the typical family purchases over time changes. As an item in the
basket becomes more expensive, families tend to substitute and replace the item with similar goods. Also,
the quality of goods changes over time. Think of how purchases in a typical household have changed over
the last two decades. Today, few families purchase answering machines, CDs, DVDs, or alarm clocks;
smartphones have replaced many such products. Smartphones are even used to make purchases for
3.2 • Macroeconomics77

delivery from an online retailer. Although keeping the items in the market basket constant allows
economists to focus on price changes, the market basket quickly becomes outdated and does not reflect a
typical family’s purchases.
In an attempt to provide new measures of inflation that better represent the changing basket of goods
purchased and the purchasing habits of families, AlbertoCavalloand RobertoRigobonfounded theBillion
Prices Project. Through this academic initiative at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, prices are
collected daily from online retailers around the world. TheBillion Prices Project website
(https://openstax.org/r/billion-prices-project)provides measures for inflation using this data as well as
research papers regarding macroeconomic research.
Historical Trends in the Inflation Rate
Inflation, as measured by the CPI for 1947–2020, is displayed inFigure 3.10. The graph shows that for the past
70 years, inflation has been the norm. Although inflation dipped into negative territory several times, each
period of negative inflation was short-lived. Also, you will notice that during the 1970s and early 1980s,
inflation was abnormally high; the inflation rate remained above 5% for approximately a decade. This was also
the only time period in which the US economy experienced double-digit inflation. By the mid-1980s, inflation
had fallen below 5%, and it has remained below 5% for much of the past 35 years.
Figure3.10Rate of Inflation Measured by the Consumer Price Index, 1947–2020

TheConsumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL)is a measure of the average monthly
change in the price for goods and services paid by urban consumers between any two time periods. It can also
represent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular index includes roughly 88% of the total
population, accounting for wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed workers, short-
term workers, unemployed workers, retirees, and those not in the labor force.
The CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, fuels, transportation fares, service fees (e.g., water and
sewer service), and sales taxes. Prices are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and
approximately 26,000 retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price changes are
averaged with weights representing their importance in the spending of a particular group. The index
measures price changes (as a percent change) from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the
original unadjusted index distributed, the BLS also releases a seasonally adjusted index. The unadjusted series
reflects all factors that may influence a change in prices. However, it can be very useful to look at the
783 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates
Access for free at openstax.org

seasonally adjusted CPI, which removes the effects of seasonal changes such as weather, the school year,
production cycles, and holidays.
The CPI can be used to recognize periods of inflation and deflation. Significant increases in the CPI within a
short time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant decreases in CPI within a short time frame
might indicate a period of deflation. However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might
not be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods. For more accurate detection, the core CPI,
orCPILFESL(https://openstax.org/r/fred-stlouisfed-org)—the CPIAUCSL minus food and energy—is often
used. When using the CPI, please note that it is not applicable to all consumers and should not be used to
determine relative living costs. Additionally, the CPI is a statistical measure vulnerable to sampling error
because it is based on a sample of prices and not the complete average.
Unemployment
Unemployment is a measure of people who are not working. For the individuals who find themselves without
a job, unemployment causes financial hardship. From a macroeconomics standpoint, unemployment means
that society has labor resources that are not being fully utilized.
Not everyone who is without a job isunemployed. To be considered unemployed, a person must be (1)
jobless, (2) actively seeking work, and (3) able to take a job. The official unemployment rate is the percentage
of the labor force that is unemployed. It is calculated as
Note that the unemployment rate is calculated as the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed, rather
than the percent of the total population. Only those who are currently employed or who meet the definition of
being unemployed are counted in the labor force. In other words, someone who is retired or a stay-at-home
parent and is not seeking employment is not counted as unemployed and is not part of the labor force.
TheBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)of theUS Department of Laborreports the unemployment rate each
month. These figures are attained through an interview process of 60,000 households conducted by the
Census Bureau. (SeeFigure 3.11for a graphic representation of historical trends in unemployment from 1950
to early 2021.)

Gross Domestic Product
Gross domestic product (GDP)is a measure of the size of an economy. A country’s GDP is the dollar value of
all of the final goods and service produced within that country during a year. GDP measures the value of all of
the automobiles produced, apples grown, heart surgeries performed, students educated, and all other new
goods and services produced in a current year.
How Is GDP Measured?
GDP can be measured by adding up all of the items that are purchased in the economy. Purchases are divided
into four broad expenditure categories: consumption spending, investment, government spending, and net
exports. Consumption spending measures the items that households purchase, such as movie theater tickets,
cups of coffee, and clothing. Consumption expenditure accounts for about two-thirds of the US GDP.

Investment spending refers primarily to purchases by businesses. It is important to note that in this context,
the terminvestmentdoes not refer to purchasing stocks and bonds or trading financial securities. Instead, the
term refers to purchasing new capital goods, such as buildings, machinery, and equipment, that will be used
to produce other goods. Residential housing is also included in the investment-spending category, as are
inventories. Products that producers make but do not sell this year (and so are not included in consumption

spending) are included in this year’s GDP calculation through the investment component. The investment
spending category is roughly 15% to 18% of the US GDP.
Government spending includes spending by federal, state, and local governments. Federal spending would
include purchases of items such as a new military fighter jet and services such as the work of economists at
the BLS. State governments purchase products such as concrete for a new highway and services such as the
work of state troopers. Local governments purchase a variety of goods and services, such as books for the city
library, playground equipment for the community park, and the services of public school teachers. In the
United States, government spending accounts for nearly 20% of the GDP.
Some items that are produced in the United States are sold to individuals, businesses, or government entities
outside of the United States. For example, a bottle of Tabasco sauce produced in Louisiana may be sold to a
restaurant in Vietnam, or tires produced in Ohio may be sold to an auto producer in Mexico. Because these
items represent production in the United States, these exports should be included in the US GDP. Conversely,
some of the items that US consumers, businesses, and government entities purchase are not produced in the
United States. A family may purchase maple syrup from Canada or a Samsung television that was produced in
South Korea. A business may purchase a Toyota vehicle that was produced in Japan. These items are imported
from other countries and represent production in the country of origin rather than the United States. Because
we already counted these items when adding consumption, investment, and government spending, we must
subtract the value of imports in our GDP calculation. Net exports equals exports from the United States minus
imports from other countries. Including net exports in the GDP calculation adjusts for this international trade.
Historical Trends in GDP
USGDPover the past 70 years is represented by the blue line inFigure 3.12. At the turn of the millennium, the
yearly GDP of the United States was approximately $10 trillion. By 2020, the GDP exceeded $21 trillion,
indicating that the US economy had more than doubled in size in the first 20 years of the 21st century.
5
Because GDP is the market value of all goods and services produced, it can increase either because more
goods and services are being produced or because the market value of these goods and services is rising. If
100 cars were produced and sold for $30,000 each, that would contribute $3,000,000 to the GDP. If, instead, the
cars were sold for $33,000 each, the same 100-car production would contribute $3,300,000 to the GDP. The
$300,000 increase in GDP would be due simply to higher prices, or inflation.
Multiplying the current price of goods by the number of goods produced results in what is known as nominal
GDP. In order to determine what the actual increase in production is, nominal GDP must be adjusted for
inflation. This adjustment results in a calculation known as real GDP. To calculate real GDP, the amounts of
goods and services produced are multiplied by the price levels in a base year. Thus, real GDP will rise only if
more goods and services are being produced. The red line inFigure 3.12represents the real GDP. Although its
growth has not been as large as that of nominal GDP, real GDP has also grown significantly over the past 70
years.

Figure 3.14is an illustration of the growth of GDP over time. There has been a definitive long-term upward
trend in GDP, but it has not been in a straight line. Instead, the economy has expanded much like the curve;
periods of quick growth are followed by slower or even negative growth. These alternating growth periods are
known as thebusiness cycle.
Figure3.14Growth of GDP and the Business Cycle
Stages of the Business Cycle
The business cycle consists of a period of economic expansion followed by a period of economic contraction.
During the period of economicexpansion, GDP rises. Employment expands as businesses produce more;
conversely, unemployment falls. Other measures of economic growth may include increased new business
starts and new home construction. The economy is said to be “heating up.” As the expansion continues,
inflation often becomes a concern.

3.3 • Business Cycles and Economic Activity83

Fast-paced economic expansion is not sustainable. Eventually, growth slows and unemployment rises. The
economy has moved from expansion to contraction when this occurs. The point at which the business cycle
turns from expansion to contraction is known as thepeak. The point at which the contraction ends and the
economy begins to expand again is known as thetrough. The length of one business cycle is measured by the
time from one trough to the trough of the next cycle, as shown inFigure 3.15.
Figure3.15Stages of the Business Cycle
Often, the contraction is referred to as arecession. A private think tank, theNational Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER), tracks the business cycle in the United States. The NBER is the entity that officially declares
recessions in the United States. Historically, a recession was defined as two consecutive quarters of declining
GDP. Today, the NBER defines a recession in a broader, less precise manner; it will declare a recession when
there is a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts for at least a few
months.

Measures of real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale and retail sales are
considered in addition to real GDP.

National Bureau of Economic Research
The National Bureau of Economic Research was founded in 1920 to create measures of economic activity
that could be used in public policy discussions. It is a private, nonpartisan organization that conducts
research that is followed by businesses and the public sector. You can find out more about the NBER and
view many of its research papers by visitingits website(https://openstax.org/r/nber-website).
Historical Trends
The NBER has identified business cycle peaks and troughs in data going back to the mid-19th century.Figure
3.16lists each of these cycles, denoting the months of peaks and troughs. We see a repetition of the economic
behavior—an expansion, a peak, a recession, and a trough, followed by yet another expansion, peak,
recession, and trough. The cycles are events that repeatedly occur in the same order.

However, the cycles are not identical; the lengths of the cycles vary greatly. On average, the contractions have
lasted about 17 months and expansions have lasted about 41 months. The typical business cycle has been
about 4.5 years long.
At the time of this writing, the United States is in an economic recession.

The previous trough was in June
2009. From the summer of 2009 through February 2020, the US economy was in the expansionary phase of the
business cycle. This expansion peaked in February 2020, when the economy fell into a contractionary period
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This 128-month expansion is the longest expansion in US history.
Only two other expansions have lasted for over 100 months: the 120-month expansion that ran through the
1990s and the 106-month expansion that ran during the 1960s. The longest recessionary period on record is
the 65-month recession that occurred during the 1870s. The recession that began in 1929 was the second-
longest recession in US history. At 43 months long, this recession that ended in 1933 was so severe that it has
been called the Great Depression.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain the relationship between the nominal interest rate and inflation.
•Calculate the real rate of interest.
•Explain the relationship between interest rates and risk.
Market for Loanable Funds
An interest rate is the rental price of money. The concepts of supply, demand, and equilibrium apply in this
market just as they do in other markets. This market is referred to as themarket for loanable funds.
In the market for loanable funds, the suppliers of funds are economic entities that currently have a surplus in
their budget. In other words, they have more income than they currently want to spend; they would like to
save some of their money and spend it in future time periods. Instead of just putting these savings in a box on
a shelf for safekeeping until they want to spend it, they can let someone else borrow that money. In essence,
they are renting that money to someone else, who pays a rental price called theinterest rate.
The suppliers of loanable funds, also known as lenders, are represented by the upward-sloping curve inFigure
3.17. A higher interest rate will encourage these lenders to supply a larger quantity of loanable funds.
The demanders of funds in the loanable funds market are economic entities that currently have a deficit in
their budget. They want to spend more than they currently have in income. For example, a grocery store chain
that wants to expand into new cities and build new grocery stores will need to spend money on land and
buildings. The cost of buying the land and buildings exceeds the chain’s current income. In the long run, its
business expansion will be profitable, and it can pay back the money that it has borrowed.
The downward-sloping curve inFigure 3.17represents the demanders of loanable funds, also known as
borrowers. Higher interest rates will be associated with lower quantities demanded of loanable funds. At lower
interest rates, more borrowers will be interested in borrowing larger quantities of funds because the price of
renting those funds will be cheaper.
Figure3.17Equilibrium in the Loanable Funds Market
The equilibrium interest rate is determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. At that
interest rate, the quantity supplied of loanable funds exactly equals the quantity demanded of loanable funds.
There is no shortage of loanable funds, nor is there any surplus.

Nominal Interest Rates
Thenominal interest rateis the stated, or quoted, interest rate. If you want to borrow money to purchase a
car and the bank quotes an interest rate of 5.5% on a four-year auto loan, the 5.5% is the nominal interest rate.
Or suppose you have $1,000 you would like to place in a savings account. If the bank quotes an interest rate of
6% on its savings accounts, the 6% is a nominal interest rate. This means that if you place your $1,000 in a
savings account for one year, you will receive $60 in interest for the year. At the end of the year, you will have a
balance of $1,060 in your savings account—your original $1,000 plus the $60 in interest that you earned.
Real Interest Rates
Suppose you are deciding between saving your $1,000 for the year and using it to purchase a flat-screen TV.
The advantage of spending the money on the TV today is that you can enjoy watching programs on it over the
next year. The advantage of saving the money is that you will earn 6% nominal interest; in one year, you will
have $1,060 to spend.
If there is a 2% inflation rate, you would expect the TV that costs $1,000 today to cost $1,020 in one year. If you
save the $1,000, you will have $1,060 in one year. You could purchase the TV for $1,020 and have $40 left over;
then you could use the $40 to order pizza to celebrate the first big game you are watching on the new TV.
Your choice comes down to enjoying a TV today or enjoying a TV and $40 in one year. The $40 is your reward
for delaying consumption. It is your real return for saving money. The remaining $20 of the interest you
earned just covered the rate of inflation. This reward for delaying consumption is known as thereal interest
rate. The real interest rate is calculated as
The real interest rate, rather than the nominal interest rate, is the true determinant of the cost of borrowing
and the reward for lending. For example, if a business had to pay 15% nominal interest rate in 1980, when the
inflation rate was 12%, the real cost of borrowing for the firm was 3%. The company would have had to pay $15
in interest each year for each $100 it borrowed, but $12 of that was simply compensating the lender for
inflation. In real terms, the business was only paying $3 to borrow $100.
In recent years, a business may have paid 6% interest to borrow money. This nominal rate is half of what it was
in 1980. However, inflation has been much lower. If inflation is 1% and the company pays 6% nominal interest,
that results in a 5% real interest rate. For every $100 the company borrows, it pays $6 in interest; $1 is
compensating for inflation, and the remaining $5 is the real cost of borrowing.
Risk Premiums
As we have discussed interest rates, we have talked about how the interest rate is determined by the demand
and supply of loanable funds. This tells us the underlying interest rate in the economy. You will notice,
however, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any
given time.
Figure 3.18shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.
The bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month
period. This rate is often referred to as the risk-free rate of interest. While theoretically it would be possible for
the US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that
are occurring are extremely low.
When someone borrows money, they enter into a contract to repay the money and the interest owed.
However, sometimes, certain circumstances arise such that the lender has a difficult time collecting the
money, even though the lender has the legal right to the money. For example, if a company goes bankrupt
after borrowing the money and before paying back the loan, the lender may not be able to collect what is due.
The chance that the lender may not be able to collect all of the money due at the time it is due is considered
3.4 • Interest Rates87

credit risk. Lenders want to be rewarded for taking on this risk, so they charge a premium to borrowers who
are higher risk.
Companies are more likely to go bankrupt and not be able to pay their bills on time than is the US
government. So, corporations have to pay a higher interest rate than the US government. If a lender can earn
1% lending to the US government, the lender will only be willing to lend to the riskier corporation if they can
earn more than 1%. InFigure 3.18, the interest rates paid by very creditworthy companies is shown. The prime
rate is the interest rate that banks charge their very best customers—large companies that are financially very
strong and have a very low risk of default.
It is generally riskier for a lender to make a loan to an individual than to a corporation. Individuals are more
likely to become ill, lose their job, or experience some other financial setback that makes it difficult for them to
repay their loans. InFigure 3.18, the interest rate on credit card loans is much higher than the interest rate
charged to corporate borrowers. That is because credit card loans are a high risk to the lender. Unlike other
loans made to an individual, such as a car loan, the credit card company has no collateral if a consumer cannot
pay back the loan. With car loans, if the borrower fails to repay the borrowed money, the lender can repossess
the automobile and sell it to recoup some of the money it is owed. If you use a credit card to buy groceries and
do not repay the loan, the credit card company cannot repossess the groceries that you purchased. Therefore,
credit card loans have notoriously high interest rates to compensate the lender for the high risk.

3.5Foreign Exchange Rates
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain what it means for a currency to appreciate or depreciate.
•Define spot exchange rate.
•Explain the risks involved in translation exposure.
Spot Exchange Rate
An exchange rate is simply the price of a currency. If you live in the United States and are going on a trip to
Mexico, you will need pesos to pay for your food, hotel, and other items. You will need to purchase pesos.
Suppose that you go to your bank to purchase pesos. Suppose the bank tells you that it will cost $0.0625 to
purchase one Mexican peso. If you want to take 10,000 Mexican pesos with you on your trip, it will cost you
$625 to purchase the desired pesos.
In this example, the price of one peso is six and one-quarter cents. This price will often be written in the form
of
MXN is an abbreviation for theMexican peso, and USD is an abbreviation for the US dollar. This price is known
as a currency exchange rate, or the rate at which you can exchange one currency for another currency.
Because this is the price you would pay to purchase Mexican pesos right now, it is known as thespot
exchange rate.
If you know the price of Mexican pesos in dollars, you can easily find the price of US dollars in Mexican pesos.
Simply divide both sides of the equation by 0.0625, or the price of a peso:
If you have Mexican pesos and you want to exchange them for dollars, you will be using the pesos to buy
dollars. Each US dollar will cost you MXN 16.
LINK TO LEARNING
Currency Conversion
Do you want to know how many British pounds your $100 would buy? Or would you like to see how much
that 10,000-yen-per-night hotel room will cost you in your home currency? You can enter the amount of one
currency in theMSN Money currency converter(https://openstax.org/r/currencyconverter)to see what the
equivalent amount is in another currency.
Currency Appreciation
Just as the price of gasoline changes, resulting in it costing more to purchase gasoline on some visits to the
gas station than on other visits, the price of a currency also changes. Currency appreciation occurs when it
costs more to purchase a currency than it did before.
If the next time you go to the bank to purchase pesos, the bank quotes an exchange rate of
, it means that it now costs $0.0800 (up from $0.0625) to purchase a Mexican peso.
Hence, the price of a peso has risen, or the peso has appreciated.
3.5 • Foreign Exchange Rates89

Currency prices are determined in the marketplace through the same types of supply-and-demand forces we
discussed earlier in this chapter. What would cause the peso to appreciate? Either an increase in the demand
for pesos or a decrease in the supply of pesos.
Currency Depreciation
Just as a currency can appreciate, it can depreciate. If the quote at the bank was, it
would only cost $0.0500 to purchase a Mexican peso. When it costs fewer dollars to purchase a peso, the peso
has depreciated. Either a decrease in demand for pesos or an increase in supply of pesos will cause the peso to
depreciate.
Because an exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency, if one of the
currencies depreciates, the other currency must, by definition, appreciate. If it costs $0.0500 to purchase a
Mexican peso, the price of a US dollar, in terms of a Mexican peso would be calculated as
So, the price of one US dollar would be 20 Mexican pesos.
Exchange Rate Risk
Businesses that engage in international business face currency exchange rate risk. As exchange rates change,
a business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks,transaction exposure, is the risk that the
value of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange
rates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for
example, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in
pesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange
rate is, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is
, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and
the US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso
appreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.
Firms that hold assets in a foreign country also facetranslation exposure. When a company creates its
financial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of
how items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.
Economic exposureis the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers
and sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United
States or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting
in their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a
depreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange
their pesos. A Mexican who wants to stay at a $200-per-night hotel in Colorado will need more pesos to pay for
the room when the peso depreciates. The depreciating peso will likely mean that more Mexicans will spend
their vacation week inMexico, and fewer will vacation in the United States.
Even businesses that do not view themselves as involved in international business can face economic
exposure. The ski lodge in Colorado will find that its customers from Mexico decrease when the dollar
appreciates. Likewise, when the dollar appreciates, some of the ski lodge’s US-based customers may choose
instead to visit a resort in Mexico, where their purchasing power is strong.

Levels versus Percentage Changes
The same information can be presented in graphs several different ways. The particular format you choose will
depend on how you are using the data.
Figure 3.19shows the real GDP ofJapanfor 2010–2020. This chart is created showing the level of real GDP. The
steep drop in 2020 highlights the economic decline associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking at the
chart, it is easy to see that after 10 years of a general upward trend, Japan’s GDP quickly fell to a level not seen
in the previous decade as COVID-19 began spreading in early 2020.
Figure3.19Real Gross Domestic Product for Japan, 2010–2020

The vertical axis inFigure 3.19is measured in yen. Over the time period shown, the real GDP ranged from 500
trillion yen to 560 trillion yen. The general trend (until COVID-19) was upward, indicating growth in the
Japanese economy. However, the growth was not consistent from year to year.

percent change for each quarter on the vertical axis. It is created using the same underlying data asFigure

The formula to calculate the percentage change from one quarter to the next is
In the first quarter of 2013, the real GDP for Japan was 522,594.2 billion yen. In the second quarter of 2013, the
real GDP had risen to 527,277.0 billion yen. Thus, the percentage change in real GDP from quarter one to
quarter two was
As long as the percentage change for a quarter is positive, the real GDP inFigure 3.20will rise; this indicates
that the economy is growing. If the percentage change shown inFigure 3.20is negative, then real GDP will fall;
this indicates that the economy is contracting. Looking at the percentage change inFigure 3.20is helpful for
detecting when the economy is growing but the growth is slowing. If the percentage change is positive but
lower than it was for the previous quarter, then GDP is growing, but the growth rate is slowing.
Indexes
Anindexis created to track the performance of a particular aspect of the economy or the financial markets. An
index helps compare the level of a variable at one point in time relative to another point in time. Indexes are
often used when movement over time is more important than the absolute level of the variable at any one
point in time.
Earlier in this chapter, we looked at the rate of change in the CPI to measure the rate of inflation. In its raw
form, the CPI is an index. Remember that the CPI is a measure of the cost of a market basket of goods. When
the index is created, the total cost of the market basket, whether it is $300 or $950, is irrelevant. What
economists are interested in is the magnitude of the difference in cost of the same market basket at a later
date.
In order to focus on the change over time, a base year is identified. The cost of the market basket in the base

year is given an index level of 100. Let’s assume that the market basket costs $300 in the base year. If the same
basket of goods costs $330 the following year, then the index level the following year would be 110. The index
level increases by 10% when the cost of the market basket increases by 10%. This makes it easy to compare
different measures of inflation.
For example, suppose a market basket costs 40,000 yen in the first year and 42,000 yen in the second year. In
the base year, the CPI in Japan would be set at 100; the following year, the index would rise to 105 (because of
the 5% rise in the market basket cost). Comparing the levels of the index in Japan with the index in the United
States allows you to compare inflation trends in the two countries.
Table 3.6contains the CPI for the United States, Japan, and Switzerland for each decade since 1970. A base year
of 1970 is used for all three countries, so the index level is 100 for all three countries in 1970. You can see that
Japan has experienced virtually no inflation for the last several decades. If the index level remains the same
from one year to the next, there is a zero rate of inflation. Negative rates of inflation, or deflation, would be
associated with a falling index level.

Using an index level helps us compare the impact that inflation has had on the cost of living in the three
countries. Prices were rising rapidly in Japan in the 1970s, outpacing price increases in both the United States
and Switzerland. By the mid-1980s, however, price increases in Japan tapered off. Although prices in
Switzerland rose much more slowly in the 1970s, the price level continued to rise over the next couple of
decades. Even though the price increases have followed different patterns in Switzerland and Japan, the
overall price level today is about three times what it was in 1970 in both of those countries. However, the price
level in the United States has continued to rise; today, the price level in the United States is about seven times
higher than it was in in the 1970s.

Summary
3.1Microeconomics
Microeconomics is the study of individual economic decision makers. In the marketplace, buyers and sellers
come together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated
with a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher
prices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves
determines the equilibrium price and quantity.
3.2Macroeconomics
Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,
unemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.
Unemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic
product is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.
3.3Business Cycles and Economic Activity
The business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a
trough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also
known as a recession, the economy is slowing down.
3.4Interest Rates
The interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of
interest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a
risk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.
3.5Foreign Exchange Rates
A foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency. If a currency will purchase
more of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have appreciated. If a
currency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to

Why It Matters
Emma, an accounting major, was on her way to her Wednesday morning accounting class with her friend Sam.
Sam, a finance major, kept complaining to Emma that he didn’t enjoy their accounting class at all. “Why do we
have to spend so much time worried about debits, credits, accounts, and all this other accounting jargon
anyway? I’m a finance major. I won’t be spending my days recording entries and counting pennies. I’m
dreading class today. I looked at the syllabus, we’re studying the accrual method. So what? Just give me the
financial statements so I have the data I need.”
Emma smiled at her friend and thought for a moment before responding. Emma loves the details of debits,
credits, and “all that other accounting jargon,” as Sam put it. She knows that while not everyone enjoys the
details or understands them, they do play a big role in the timing and accuracy of financial statements. “Yeah,
yeah, Sam, accounting isn’t always easy or fun, but it’s important. The financial statements you will use in
finance are a part of the foundation for many decisions. They are an important tool. Even though you don’t
have to create financial statements in a finance role, it’s still necessary to understand the accounting principles
they are based on. We haven’t covered the details yet, but I do know that income or loss in a period can be
significantly different if the income statement is prepared under cash versus accrual methods. I would think
that would be important to know if you are the one using the income statement.”

4.1Cash versus Accrual Accounting
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Outline the key concepts of the cash-basis accounting method.
•Explain the key characteristics of the accrual-basis accounting method.
•Identify businesses for which cash accounting or accrual accounting is more appropriate.
In this section, we will explore the basic elements of cash and accrual accounting and the businesses that are
most likely to use each one. Some private companies may choose to usecash-basis accountingrather than
accrual-basis accountingto report financial information.
Cash-Basis Accounting
In business, cash is certainly important. In fact, it’s so important that it dictates one of two ways we can
account for our business transactions. Thecash methodis just as the name implies—it records transactions
only when cash flows. We track cash inflows and outflows as they occur. This method is most commonly used
by small businesses that deal primarily in cash transactions. The other method, called theaccrual method,
records transactions when they occur, rather than waiting for cash to be accumulated. Using the accrual
method, we match cash inflows and the outflows required to generate them. We call this thematching
principle. This method is used by most publicly traded companies. In this chapter, you’ll explore both methods,
see how each impacts financial statements differently, note the role of timing in each method, and learn how
and when to record capital and expense transactions.
Let’s look at an example. Chris just finished the first month of her landscaping business operations at the end
of August, and she used the cash method of accounting to figure out hernet income. Most small start-up
companies use the cash method of accounting because it is easy to understand, requires no special training,
and helps them focus on one big key to their survival—cash. This means that she simply recorded the cash
that came in and the cash that went out of her business. She brought in $1,400 in revenue in her first month,
which she felt was substantial given that it was her first month. But after deducting her expenses, she had only
$250 left, so she worried about the future of her business. Would she have to increase her sales exponentially
in order to start bringing in a decent profit each month?
As you move through the chapter, you’ll get to see the impact of the two methods of accounting and how
these methods impact the insights and decisions Chris made for her new business.
Cash-basis accounting is a method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial
statements until there is an exchange of cash. Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of
revenueandexpensereporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris
measured the performance of her landscaping business for the month of August using cash flows. Cash
accounting is far simpler to track than accrual-basis accounting.
Accrual-Basis Accounting
Public companies reporting their financial positions use either US generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) orInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as allowed under theSecurities and Exchange
Commission (SEC)regulations. GAAP is a set of accounting standards created by theFinancial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB)and theGovernmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). It’s key to note that
though they are similar in many areas, there are still key areas that differ between GAAP and IFRS. Therefore,
when using financial statements, it’s important to be aware of the standards under which they were prepared.
However, public or private companies using GAAP or IFRS must prepare their financial statements using the
rules of accrual accounting. Accrual-basis accounting prescribes that revenues and expenses must be
recorded in the accounting period in which they were earned or incurred, no matter when cash receipts or
payments occur. It is because of accrual accounting that we have the revenue recognition principle and the
1024 • Accrual Accounting Process
Access for free at openstax.org

expense recognition principle (also known as the matching principle).
The accrual method is considered to better match revenues and expenses and standardizes reporting
information for comparability purposes. Having comparable information is important to external users of
information trying to make investment or lending decisions and to internal users trying to make decisions
about company performance, budgeting, and growth strategies.
Who Uses Each Method?
Cash-basis accounting can be more efficient and well-suited for certain types of businesses, such as farming or
professional services provided by lawyers and doctors. However, the accrual basis of accounting is
theoretically preferable to the cash basis of accounting because it takes into account the timing of the
transactions (when goods and services are provided and when the cash involved in the transactions is
received). Cash can often be received a significant amount of time after the initial transaction. Considering this
amount allows accountants to provide, in a timely manner, relevant and complete information to stakeholders.
There are several reasons accrual-basis accounting is preferred to cash-basis accounting. Accrual-basis
accounting is required by GAAP because it typically provides a better sense of the financial well-being of a
company. Accrual-based accounting information allows management to analyze a company’s progress, and
management can use that information to improve their business. Accrual accounting is also used to assist
companies in securing financing because banks will typically require a company to provide accrual-basis
financial income statements. TheInternal Revenue Servicerequires businesses to report using accrual-basis
information when preparing tax returns. In addition, companies with inventory must use accrual-based
accounting for income tax purposes, though there are exceptions to the general rule.
So why might a company use cash-basis accounting? Companies that do not sell stock publicly can use cash-
basis instead of accrual-basis accounting for internal management purposes or because they are exempt from
such requirements in agreements such as a bank loan. Cash-basis accounting is a simpler accounting system
to use than an accrual-basis accounting system when tracking real-time revenues and expenses.
THINK IT THROUGH
Cash- or Accrual-Basis Accounting?
You are a new accountant at a beauty salon. The salon had previously used cash-basis accounting to
prepare its financial records but is now considering switching to an accrual-basis method. You have been
tasked with determining if this transition is appropriate.
When you go through the records, you notice that this transition will greatly impact how the salon reports
revenues and expenses. The salon will now report some revenues and expenses before it receives or pays
cash.
How will this change positively impact its business reporting? How will it negatively impact its business
reporting? If you were the accountant, would you recommend the salon transition from cash basis to
accrual basis?
Solution:
Accrual accounting creates a more accurate picture of profit or loss, so the salon’s owner can have a better
understanding of its profitability from period to period. However, it can be more work to record under
accrual accounting. If the salon is small and the profits and costs are easily understood, it might not be
worth the extra effort to the owner to use accrual-basis accounting. If the salon is seeking ways to better
understand profits and costs, accrual-basis accounting would be a great choice.

4.2Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Assess the impact of business transactions on cash flow.
•Define double-entry accounting and explain how it supports the accounting equation.
How and when we record our transactions can have a significant impact on financial statements, especially the
income statement (net income). In this section you will explore the impact business transactions have on
financial statements under each method. In doing so, you’ll be introduced todouble-entry accountingand
see how it functions to support the accounting equation.
Timing of Business Activity versus Cash Flow
The first financial statement prepared is the income statement, a statement that shows the organization’s
financial performancefor a given period of time. We already saw that Chris, who is a sole proprietor, started a
summer landscaping business on August 1, 2020. She categorized her business as a service entity and used
the cash-basis method of accounting to record the initial operations for her business. Although Chris was
using her family’s tractor to get her work done, she was responsible for paying for fuel and any maintenance
costs. So, on August 31, Chris realized she had only $250 in her checking account.
This balance was lower than expected because she had spent only slightly less ($1,150 for brakes, fuel, and
insurance) than she earned ($1,400)—leaving a net income of $250. While she would like the checking balance
to grow each month, she realized that most of the August expenses were infrequent (brakes and insurance)
and the insurance, in particular, was an unusually large expense. She knew that the checking account balance
would likely grow more in September because she would earn money from some new customers; she also
anticipated having fewer expenses.
This simple landscaping example can be used to discuss the elements of the income statement, which are
revenues, expenses,gains, andlossesfor a particular period of time (seeFigure 4.2). Together, these
determine whether the organization has net income (where revenues and gains are greater than expenses
and losses) or net loss (where expenses and losses are greater than revenues and gains). Revenues, expenses,
gains, and losses are further defined in the Income Statement provided.
Figure4.2Income Statement forChris’s Landscaping
The income statement can also be visualized by the formula:
Let’s change this example slightly and assume the $1,000 payment to the insurance company will be paid in
1044 • Accrual Accounting Process
Access for free at openstax.org

September rather than in August. In this case, the ending balance in Chris’s checking account would be $1,250,
a result of earning $1,400 and only spending $100 for the brakes on the tractor and $50 for fuel. This stream of
cash flows is an example of cash-basis accounting because it reflects when payments are received and made,
not necessarily the time period that they affect. At the end of this section, you will address accrual accounting,
which does reflect the time period that payments affect.
The Accounting Equation
It may be helpful to think of theaccounting equationfrom a “sources and claims” perspective. Under this
approach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by incurring liabilities or were provided
by owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.
You may recall from mathematics courses that an equation must always be in balance. Therefore, we must
ensure that the two sides of the accounting equation are always equal. We will explore the components of the
accounting equation in more detail shortly. First, we need to examine several underlying concepts that form
the foundation for the accounting equation: the double-entry accounting system, debits and credits, and the
“normal” balance for each account that is part of a formal accounting system.
THINK IT THROUGH
The Accounting Equation
On a sheet of paper, use three columns to create your own accounting equation. In the first column, list all
the things you own (assets). List only the asset itself; don’t worry about any associated liabilities (expenses)
in that column. In the second column, list any amounts owed (the liabilities). When you are done, total up
all the assets. Then total up all the liabilities.
Now, use the accounting equation to calculate the net amount of the asset (equity). To do so, subtract the
total assets from the total liabilities. This figure makes the accounting equation balance and represents
equity, or an estimate of your net worth.
Here is something else to consider: Is it possible to have negative equity? It sure is . . . ask any college
student who has taken out loans. At first glance there is no asset directly associated with the amount of the
loan. But is that, in fact, the case? You might ask yourself why you should make an investment in a college
education—what is the benefit (asset) to going to college? The answer lies in the difference in lifetime
earnings with a college degree versus without a college degree. This is influenced by many things, including
the supply and demand of jobs and employees. It is also influenced by the earnings for the type of college
degree pursued.
Solution:
Answers will vary but may include vehicles, clothing, electronics (include cell phones and computer/gaming
systems), and sports equipment. They may also include money owed on these assets, most likely vehicles
and perhaps cell phones. In the case of a student loan, there may be a liability with no corresponding asset
(yet). Responses should be able to evaluate the benefit of investing in college and the wage differential
between earnings with and without a college degree.
Let’s continue our exploration of the accounting equation, focusing on the equity component in particular.
Recall that we defined equity as the net worth of an organization. It is helpful to also think of net worth as the
accountingvalueof the organization. Recall, too, that revenues (inflows as a result of providing goods and
services)increasethe accounting value of the organization. So every dollar of revenue an organization
generates increases the overall value of the organization.
4.2 • Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting105

Likewise, expenses (outflows as a result of generating revenue)decreasethe value of the organization. So
each dollar of expenses an organization incurs decreases the overall value of the organization. The same
approach can be taken with the other elements of the financial statements:
•Gainsincreasethe value (equity) of the organization.
•Lossesdecreasethe value (equity) of the organization.
•Investments by ownersincreasethe value (equity) of the organization.
•Distributions to ownersdecreasethe value (equity) of the organization.
•Changes in assets and liabilities caneitherincrease or decrease the value (equity) of the organization
depending on the net result of the transaction.
Let’s look at Chris’s Landscaping business again and do the same quick exercise you did with your personal
finances. If we were to total all of Chris’s assets, we would find just one: $250 in cash. She’s using the family’s
tractor, but she doesn’t own the tractor, so it is not her asset. Her liabilities are currently $0, as she paid cash
for all the expenses she incurred already. If we total her assets, we get $250. Liabilities total $0. Using the
accounting equation, we find her equity to currently be $250, or
Double-Entry Accounting
Accounting is based on a double-entry accounting system, which requires the following:
•Each time we record a transaction, we must record a change in at least two different accounts. Having two
or more accounts change will allow us to keep the accounting equation in balance.
•Not only will at least two accounts change, but there must also be at least onedebitand onecreditside
impacted.
•The sum of the debits must equal the sum of the credits for each transaction.
In order for companies to record the myriad of transactions they have each year, there is a need for a simple
but detailed system. Journals are useful tools to meet this need.
Debits and Credits
Each account can be represented visually by splitting the account into left and right sides as shown. The
graphic representation of a general ledger account is known as aT-account. It is called this because it looks
like a “T,” as you can see with the T-account shown inFigure 4.3.
Figure4.3T-Account
A debit records financial information on the left side of each account. A credit records financial information on
the right side of an account. One side of each account will increase, and the other side will decrease. The
ending account balance is found by calculating the difference between debits and credits for each account.
You will often see the termsdebitandcreditrepresented in shorthand, written asDRordrandCRorcr,
respectively. Depending on the account type, the sides that increase and decrease may vary. We can illustrate
each account type and its corresponding debit and credit effects in the form of anexpandedequation (see
Figure 4.4).

Figure4.4Expanded Accounting Equation
As we can see from this expanded accounting equation, Assets accounts increase on the debit side and
decrease on the credit side. This is also true of Dividends and Expenses accounts. Liabilities increase on the
credit side and decrease on the debit side. This is also true of Common Stock and Revenues accounts. This
becomes easier to understand as you become familiar with thenormal balanceof an account.
The balance sheet is a reflection of the accounting equation (seeFigure 4.5). It has two sections, assets in one
section and liabilities and equity in the other section. It’s key to note that both assets and liabilities are broken
down on the balance sheet into current and noncurrent classifications in order to provide more detail and
transparency. Current assets are those that are consumed within a year. Assets that will be in use longer than
a year are considered noncurrent. Current liabilities are those that will be due within a year. Noncurrent
liabilities are those that are due more than a year into the future.
Figure4.5Graphical Representation of the Accounting EquationBoth assets and liabilities are categorized as current and
noncurrent. Also highlighted are the various activities that affect the equity (or net worth) of the business.
Notice each account subcategory (Current Assets and Noncurrent Assets, for example) has an “increase” side
and a “decrease” side. As you may recall, these are called T-accounts, and they are used to analyze
transactions.
The basic components of even the simplest accounting system areaccountsand ageneral ledger. An account
is a record showing increases and decreases to assets, liabilities, and equity—the basic components found in
the accounting equation. Each of these categories, in turn, includes many individual accounts, all of which a
company maintains in its general ledger. A general ledger is a comprehensive listing of all of a company’s
accounts with their individual balances.
4.3How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain the revenue recognition principle and how it relates to current and future sales transactions.
•Explain the expense recognition principle and how it relates to current and future purchase transactions.
•Assess the role of ethics in revenue and expense recognition.
You’ve learned the basics of each method as well as the accounting equation and double-entry accounting.
Next, let’s turn our attention to when we record transactions, as timing is key.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is the value of goods and services the organization sold or provided to customers for a given period
of time. In our current example, Chris’s landscaping business, the “revenue,” or the value of services
4.3 • How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?107

performed, for the month of August would be $1,400. It is the value Chris received in exchange for the services
provided to her clients. Likewise, when a business provides goods or services to customers for cash at the time
of the service or in the future, the business classifies the amount(s) as revenue. Just as the $1,400 revenues
from a business made Chris’s checking account balance increase, revenues increase the value of a business. In
accounting,revenue recognitioninvolves recording sales or fees earned within the period earned. Just as
earning wages from a business or summer job reflects the number of hours worked for a given rate of pay or
payments from clients for services rendered, revenues (and the other terms) are used to indicate the dollar
value of goods and services provided to customers for a given period of time.
THINK IT THROUGH
Coffee Shop Products
Think about a coffee shop in your area. Identify items the coffee shop sells that would be classified as
revenues. Remember, revenues for the coffee shop are related to its primary purpose: selling coffee and
related items. Or, better yet, make a trip to the local coffee shop and get a first-hand experience.
Solution:
Many coffee shops earn revenue through multiple revenue streams, including coffee and other specialty
drinks, food items, gift cards, and merchandise.
Short-Term Revenue Recognition Examples
Two brief examples may help illustrate the difference between cash accounting and accrual accounting.
Assume that a business sells $200 worth of merchandise. In some businesses, there are two ways the
customers pay: cash and credit (also referred to as “on account”). Cash sales include checks and credit cards
and are paid at the time of the sale. Credit sales (not to be confused with credit card sales) allow the customer
to take the merchandise but pay within a specified period of time, usually up to 45 days.
A cash sale would be recorded in the financial statements under both the cash basis and accrual basis of
accounting. It makes sense because the customer received the merchandise and paid the business at the
same time. It is considered two events that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).
A credit sale, however, would be treated differently under each of these types of accounting. Under the cash
basis of accounting, a credit sale would not be recorded in the financial statements until the cash is received,
under terms stipulated by the seller. For example, assume that in the next year of Chris’s landscaping
business, on April 1, she provides $500 worth of services to one of her customers. The sale is made on account,
with the payment due 45 days later. Under the cash basis of accounting, the revenue would not be recorded
until May 16, when the cash was received. Under the accrual basis of accounting, this sale would be recorded
in the financial statements at the time the services were provided, April 1. The reason the sale would be
recorded is that, under accrual accounting, the business reports that it provided $500 worth of services to its
customer. The fact that the customers will pay later is viewed as a separate transaction under accrual
accounting (seeFigure 4.6).

Assume a business purchases $160 worth of printing supplies from a supplier (vendor). Similar to a sale, a
purchase of merchandise can be paid for at the time of sale using cash (also a check or credit card) or at a later
date (on account). A purchase paid with cash at the time of the sale would be recorded in the financial
statements under both cash basis and accrual basis of accounting. It makes sense because the business
received the printing supplies from the supplier and paid the supplier at the same time. It is considered two
events that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).
If the purchase was made on account (also called a credit purchase), however, the transaction would be
recorded differently under each of these types of accounting. Under the cash basis of accounting, the $160
purchase on account would not be recorded in the financial statements until the cash is paid, as stipulated by
the seller’s terms. For example, if the printing supplies were received on July 17 and the payment terms were
15 days, no transaction would be recorded until August 1, when the goods were paid for. Under the accrual
basis of accounting, this purchase would be recorded in the financial statements at the time the business
received the printing supplies from the supplier (July 17). The reason the purchase would be recorded is that
the business reports that it bought $160 worth of printing supplies from its vendors. The fact that the business
will pay later is viewed as a separate issue under accrual accounting.Table 4.1summarizes these examples
under the different bases of accounting.

Table4.1How Transactions Are Viewed under Cash and Accrual Accounting
Businesses often sell items for cash as well as on account, where payment terms are extended for a period of
time (for example, 30 to 45 days). Likewise, businesses often purchase items from suppliers (also called
vendors) for cash or, more likely, on account. Under the cash basis of accounting, these transactions would not
be recorded until the cash is exchanged. In contrast, under accrual accounting, the transactions are recorded
when the transaction occurs, regardless of when the cash is received or paid.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Ethics in Revenue Recognition
Because each industry typically has a different method for recognizing income, revenue recognition is one
of the most difficult tasks for accountants, as it involves a number of ethical dilemmas related to income
reporting. To provide an industry-wide approach,Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09and other
related updates were implemented to clarify revenue recognition rules. TheAmerican Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA)announced that these updates would replace US GAAP’s current industry-
specific revenue recognition practices with a principle-based approach, potentially affecting both day-to-
day business accounting and the execution of business contracts with customers.
1
The AICPA and the
International Federation of Accountants (IFAC)require professional accountants to act with due care and to
remain abreast of new accounting rules and methods of accounting for different transactions, including
revenue recognition.
The IFAC emphasizes the role of professional accountants working within a business in ensuring the quality
of financial reporting: “Management is responsible for the financial information produced by the company.
As such, professional accountants in businesses therefore have the task of defending the quality of financial
reporting right at the source where the numbers and figures are produced!”

In accordance with proper
revenue recognition, accountants do not recognize revenue before it is earned.
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Gift Card Revenue Recognition
Gift cards have become an essential part of revenue generation and growth for many businesses. Although
they are practical for consumers and are a low cost for businesses, navigating revenue recognition
guidelines can be difficult. Gift cards with expiration dates require that revenue recognition be delayed until
customer use or expiration. However, most gift cards now have no expiration date. So when do you
recognize revenue?
Companies may need to provide an estimation of projected (or deferred) gift card revenue and usage
during a period based on past experience or industry standards. There are a few rules governing reporting.
If a company determines that a portion of all the issued gift cards will never be used, it may write this off to
income. In some states, if a gift card remains unused, in part or in full, the unused portion of the card is
transferred to the state government. It is considered unclaimed property for the customer, meaning that
the company cannot keep these funds as revenue because, in this case, they have reverted to the state
government.
Expense Recognition
An expense is a cost associated with providing goods or services to customers. In our opening example, the
expenses that Chris incurred totaled $1,150 (consisting of $100 for brakes, $50 for fuel, and $1,000 for
insurance). You might think of expenses as the opposite of revenue, in that expenses reduce Chris’s checking
account balance. Likewise, expenses decrease the value of the business and represent the dollar value of costs
incurred to provide goods and services to customers for a given period of time.

THINK IT THROUGH
Coffee Shop Expenses
While thinking about or visiting a coffee shop in your area, look around (or visualize) and identify items or
activities that are the expenses of the coffee shop. Remember, expenses for the coffee shop are related to
resources consumed while generating revenue from selling coffee and related items. Do not forget about
any expenses that might not be so obvious—as a general rule, every activity in a business has an associated
cost.
Solution:
Costs of the coffee shop that might be readily observed would include rent, wages for the employees, and
the cost of the coffee, pastries, and other items/merchandise that may be sold. In addition, costs such as
utilities, equipment, and cleaning or other supplies might also be readily observable. More obscure costs of
the coffee shop would include insurance, regulatory costs such as health department licensing, point-of-
sale/credit card costs, advertising, donations, and payroll costs such as workers’ compensation,
unemployment, and so on. There are also unseen costs, such as aging of the building (if owned by the
coffee shop) and wear and tear or aging of the equipment.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define the key characteristics of a fixed asset.
•Explain how the cost of a fixed asset is spread throughout its useful life via depreciation.
•Assess the impact to net income of expensing versus capitalizing an item.
Assets are items a business owns. For accounting purposes, assets are categorized as current versus long term
and tangible versus intangible. Any asset that is expected to be used by the business for more than one year is
considered along-term asset. These assets are not intended for resale and are anticipated to help generate
revenue for the business in the future. Some common long-term assets are computers and other office
machines, buildings, vehicles, software, computer code, and copyrights. Although these are all considered
long-term assets, some are tangible and some are intangible.
To better understand the nature of fixed assets, let’s get to know Liam and their new business. Liam is excited
to be graduating from their MBA program and looks forward to having more time to pursue their business
venture. During one of their courses, Liam came up with the business idea of creating trendy workout attire.
For their class project, they started silk-screening vintage album cover designs onto tanks, tees, and yoga
pants. They tested the market by selling their wares on campus and were surprised how quickly and how often
they sold out. In fact, sales were high enough that they decided to go into business for themselves. One of
their first decisions involved whether they should continue to pay someone else to silk-screen their designs or
do their own silk-screening. To do their own silk-screening, they would need to invest in a silk screen machine.
Liam will need to analyze the purchase of a silk screen machine to determine the impact on their business in
the short term as well as the long term, including the accounting implications related to the expense of this
machine. Liam knows that over time, the value of the machine will decrease, but they also know that an asset
is supposed to be recorded on the books at its historical cost. They also wonder what costs are considered part
of this asset. Additionally, Liam has learned about the matching principle (expense recognition) but needs to
learn how that relates to a machine that is purchased in one year and used for many years to help generate
revenue. Liam has a lot of information to consider before making this decision.
4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?111

What Is a Fixed Asset?
An asset is considered atangible assetwhen it is an economic resource that has physical substance—it can
be seen and touched. Tangible assets can be either short term, such as inventory and supplies, or long term,
such as land, buildings, and equipment. To be considered a long-term tangible asset, the item needs to be
used in the normal operation of the business for more than one year, be of material value, and not be near the
end of its useful life, and the company must have no plan to sell the item in the near future. The useful life is
the time period over which an asset cost is allocated. Long-term tangible assets are known as fixed assets. It’s
also key to note that companies willcapitalizea fixed asset if they have material value. A $10 stapler to be
used in the office, for example, may last for years, but the value of the item is not significant enough to
warrant capitalizing it.
Businesses typically need many different types of these assets to meet their objectives. These assets differ
from the company’s products. For example, the computers thatApple, Inc.intends to sell are considered
inventory (a short-term asset), whereas the computers Apple’s employees use for day-to-day operations are
long-term assets. In Liam’s case, the new silk screen machine would be considered a long-term tangible asset
as they plan to use it over many years to help generate revenue for their business. Long-term tangible assets
are listed as noncurrent assets on a company’s balance sheet. Typically, these assets are listed under the
category of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E), but they may be referred to as fixed assets or plant assets.
Apple, Inc. lists a total of $36.766 million in total Property, Plant, and Equipment (net) on its September 2020
consolidated balance sheet (seeFigure 4.7). As shown in the figure, this net total includes land and buildings,
machinery, equipment and internal-use software, and leasehold improvements, resulting in a gross PP&E of
$103.526 million—less accumulated depreciation and amortization of $66.760 million—to arrive at the net
amount of $36.766 million.

Classifying Assets and Related Expenditures
You work at a business consulting firm. Your new colleague, Milan, is helping a client company organize its
accounting records by types of assets and expenditures. Milan is a bit stumped on how to classify certain
assets and related expenditures, such as capitalized costs versus expenses. They have given you the
following list and asked for your help to sort through it. Help your colleague classify the expenditures as
either capitalized or expensed, and note which assets are property, plant, and equipment.
Expenditures:
•Normal repair and maintenance on the manufacturing facility
•Cost of taxes on new equipment used in business operations
•Shipping costs on new equipment used in business operations
•Cost of a minor repair on existing equipment used in business operations
Assets:

•Land next to the production facility held for use next year as a place to build a warehouse
•Land held for future resale when the value increases
•Equipment used in the production process
Solution:
Expenditures:
•Normal repair and maintenance on the manufacturing facility: expensed
•Cost of taxes on new equipment used in business operations: capitalized
•Shipping costs on new equipment used in business operations: capitalized
•Cost of a minor repair on existing equipment used in business operations: expensed
Assets:
•Land next to the production facility held for use next year as a place to build a warehouse: property,
plant, and equipment
•Land held for future resale when the value increases: investment
•Equipment used in the production process: property, plant, and equipment
Why are the costs of putting a long-term asset into service capitalized and written off as expenses
(depreciated) over the economic life of the asset? Let’s return to Liam’s start-up business as an example. Liam
plans to buy a silk screen machine to help create clothing that they will sell. The machine is a long-term asset
because it will be used in the business’s daily operation for many years. If the machine costs Liam $5,000 and it
is expected to be used in their business for several years, GAAP require the allocation of the machine’s costs
over its useful life, which is the period over which it will produce revenues. Overall, in determining a company’s
financial performance, we would not expect that Liam should have an expense of $5,000 this year and $0 in
expenses for this machine for future years in which it is being used. GAAP addressed this through the expense
recognition (matching) principle, which states that expenses should be recorded in the same period with the
revenues that the expense helped create. In Liam’s case, the $5,000 for this machine should be allocated over
the years in which it helps to generate revenue for the business. Capitalizing the machine allows this to occur.
As stated previously, to capitalize is to record a long-term asset on the balance sheet and expense its allocated
costs on the income statement over the asset’s economic life. Therefore, when Liam purchases the machine,
they will record it as an asset on the financial statements (see journal entry inFigure 4.8).
Figure4.8Journal Entry for Machine/Cash
When capitalizing an asset, the total cost of acquiring the asset is included in the cost of the asset. This
includes additional costs beyond the purchase price, such as shipping costs, taxes, assembly, and legal fees.
For example, if a real estate broker is paid $8,000 as part of a transaction to purchase land for $100,000, the
land would be recorded at a cost of $108,000.
Over time, as the asset is used to generate revenue, Liam will need to depreciate recognize the cost of the
asset.

depreciation and amortization” line item.
4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?113

What Is Depreciation?
When a business purchases a long-term asset (used for more than one year), it classifies the asset based on
whether the asset is used in the business’s operations. If a long-term asset is used in the business’s
operations, it will belong in property, plant, and equipment or intangible assets. In this situation, the asset is
typically capitalized. Capitalization is the process by which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet
and its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life.
Long-term assets that are not used in daily operations are typically classified as an investment. For example, if
a business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would
be included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which
the business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),
the land would be considered an investment.
Depreciationis the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, or the period of time
that the business believes it will use the asset to help generate revenue.
Fundamentals of Depreciation
As you have learned, when accounting for a long-term fixed asset, we cannot simply record an expense for the
cost of the asset and record the entire outflow of cash in one accounting period. Like all other assets, when
you purchase or acquire a long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial) cost, which includes all
costs to acquire the asset and put it into use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:
1.Record the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which places the asset on the balance sheet (as
property, plant, and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes payable, accounts payable, or an
outflow of cash.
2.At the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to recognize the depreciation expense. Depreciation
expense is the amount of the asset’s cost to be recognized, or expensed, in the current period. Companies
may record depreciation expense incurred annually, quarterly, or monthly.
Following GAAP and the expense recognition principle, the depreciation expense is recognized over the asset’s
estimated useful life.
Recording the Initial Asset
Assets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost, meaning that all costs to purchase the asset and to prepare
the asset for operation should be included. Costs outside of the purchase price may include shipping, taxes,
installation, and modifications to the asset.
The journal entry to record the purchase of a fixed asset (assuming that a note payable, not a short-term
account payable, is used for financing) is shown inFigure 4.9.
Figure4.9Journal Entry for Fixed Asset
Applying this to Liam’s silk-screening business, we learn that they purchased their silk screen machine for
$54,000 by paying $10,000 cash and the remainder in a note payable over five years. The journal entry to
record the purchase is shown inFigure 4.10.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Estimating Useful Life and Salvage Value
Useful life and salvage value are estimates made at the time an asset is placed in service. It is common and
expected that the estimates are inaccurate due to the uncertainty involved in estimating the future.
Sometimes, however, a company may attempt to take advantage of estimating salvage value and useful life
to improve earnings. A larger salvage value and longer useful life decrease annual depreciation expense
and increase annual net income. An example of this behavior is Waste Management, which was disciplined
by the SEC in March 2002 for fraudulently altering its estimates to reduce depreciation expense and
overstate net income by $1.7 billion.

Components Used in Calculating Depreciation
The expense recognition principle that requires that the cost of the asset be allocated over the asset’s useful
life is the process of depreciation. For example, if we buy a delivery truck to use for the next five years, we
would allocate the cost and record depreciation expense across the entire five-year period. The calculation of
the depreciation expense for a period is not based on anticipated changes in the fair-market value of the
asset; instead, the depreciation is based on the allocation of the cost of owning the asset over the period of its
useful life.
The following items are important in determining and recording depreciation:
•Book value: the asset’s original cost less accumulated depreciation.
•Useful life: the length of time the asset will be productively used within operations.
•Salvage (residual) value: the price the asset will sell for or be worth as a trade-in when its useful life
expires. The determination of salvage value can be an inexact science since it requires anticipating what
will occur in the future. Often, the salvage value is estimated based on past experiences with similar
assets.
•Depreciable base (cost): the depreciation expense over the asset’s useful life. For example, if we paid
$50,000 for an asset and anticipate a salvage value of $10,000, the depreciable base is $40,000. We expect
$40,000 in depreciation over the time period in which the asset was used, and then it would be sold for
$10,000.
Depreciation records an expense for the value of an asset consumed and removes that portion of the asset
from the balance sheet. The journal entry to record depreciation is shown inFigure 4.11.

4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?115

Figure4.11Journal Entry for Depreciation Expense
Depreciation expense is a common operating expense that appears on an income statement. It represents the
amount of expense being recognized in the current period. Accumulated depreciation, on the other hand,
represents the sum of all depreciation expense recognized to date, or the total of all prior depreciation
expense for the asset. It is a contra account, meaning it is attached to another account and is used to offset
the main account balance that records the total depreciation expense for a fixed asset over its life. In this case,
the asset account stays recorded at the historical value but is offset on the balance sheet by accumulated
depreciation. Accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the historical cost of the asset on the balance sheet
to show the asset at book value. Book value is the amount of the asset that has not been allocated to expense
through depreciation.
It is important to note, however, that not all long-term assets are depreciated. For example, land is not
depreciated because depreciation is the allocating of the expense of an asset over its useful life. How can one
determine a useful life for land? It is assumed that land has an unlimited useful life; therefore, it is not
depreciated, and it remains on the books at historical cost.
Once it is determined that depreciation should be accounted for, there are three methods that are most
commonly used to calculate the allocation of depreciation expense: thestraight-line method, theunits-of-
production method, and thedouble-declining-balance method. A fourth method, thesum-of-the-years-digits
method, is anotheracceleratedoption that has been losing popularity and can be learned in intermediate
accounting courses. Note that these methods are for accounting and reporting purposes. The IRS allows firms
to use the same or different methods to depreciate assets in calculating taxable income.
THINK IT THROUGH
Fixed Assets
You work for Georgia-Pacific as an accountant in charge of the fixed assets subsidiary ledger at a
production and warehouse facility in Pennsylvania. The facility is in the process of updating and replacing
several asset categories, including warehouse storage units, fork trucks, and equipment on the production
line. It is your job to keep the information in the fixed assets subsidiary ledger up to date and accurate. You
need information on original historical cost, estimated useful life, salvage value, depreciation methods, and
additional capital expenditures. You are excited about the new purchases and upgrades to the facility and
how they will help the company serve its customers better. However, you have been in your current
position for only a few years and have never overseen extensive updates, and you realize that you will have
to gather a lot of information at once to keep the accounting records accurate. You feel overwhelmed and
take a minute to catch your breath and think through what you need. After a few minutes, you realize that
you have many people and many resources to work with to tackle this project. Whom will you work with,
and how will you go about gathering what you need?
Solution:
Though answers may vary, common resources would likely include purchasing managers (those actually
buying the new equipment), maintenance managers (those who will repair and take care of the new
equipment), and line managers (those in charge of the departments that will use the new equipment). To
1164 • Accrual Accounting Process

gather the information needed, set up short meetings to visit with the individuals involved, walk around to
see the equipment, and ask questions about functionality, life span, common problems or repairs, and
more.
Assume that on January 1, Liam bought a silk screen machine for $54,000. Liam pays shipping costs of $1,500
and setup costs of $2,500 and assumes a useful life of five years or 960,000 prints. Based on experience, Liam
anticipates a salvage value of $10,000. Recall that determination of the costs to be depreciated requires
including all costs that prepare the asset for use by the company. Liam’s example would include shipping and
setup costs. Any costs for maintaining or repairing the equipment would be treated as regular expenses, so
the total cost would be $58,000, and after allowing for an anticipated salvage value of $10,000 in five years, the
business could take $48,000 in depreciation over the machine’s economic life (seeFigure 4.12).
Figure4.12Purchase Price and Depreciable Base
Straight-line depreciation is a method of depreciation that evenly splits the depreciable amount across the
useful life of the asset. Therefore, we must determine the yearly depreciation expense by dividing the
depreciable base of $48,000 by the economic life of five years, giving an annual depreciation expense of
$9,600. The journal entries to record the first two years of expenses are shown, along with the balance sheet
information. Here are the journal entry and information for year one (Figure 4.13):
Figure4.13Journal Entry for Silk Screen Machine Depreciation Expense, Year 1
After the journal entry in year one, the machine would have a book value of $48,400. This is the original cost of
$58,000 less the accumulated depreciation of $9,600. The journal entry and information for year two are shown
inFigure 4.14.
4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?117

Figure4.14Journal Entry for Silk Screen Machine Depreciation Expense, Year 2
Liam records an annual depreciation expense of $9,600. Each year, the accumulated depreciation balance
increases by $9,600, and the machine’s book value decreases by the same $9,600. At the end of five years, the
asset will have a book value of $10,000, which is calculated by subtracting the accumulated depreciation of
from the cost of $58,000.
Units-of-Production Depreciation
Straight-line depreciation is efficient accounting for assets used consistently over their lifetime, but what about
assets that are used with less regularity? The units-of-production depreciation method bases depreciation on
the actual usage of the asset, which is more appropriate when an asset’s life is a function of usage instead of
time. For example, this method could account for depreciation of a silk screen machine for which the
depreciable base is $48,000 (as in the straight-line method), but now the number of prints is important.
In our example, the machine will have total depreciation of $48,000 over its useful life of 960,000 prints.
Therefore, we would divide $48,000 by 960,000 prints to get a cost per print of $0.05. If Liam printed 180,000
items in the first year, the depreciation expense would be. The
journal entry to record this expense would be the same as with straight-line depreciation: only the dollar
amount would have changed. The presentation of accumulated depreciation and the calculation of the book
value would also be the same. Liam would continue to depreciate the asset until a total of $48,000 in
depreciation was taken after running 960,000 total prints.
THINK IT THROUGH
Deciding on a Depreciation Method
Liam is struggling to determine which deprecation method they should use for their new silk screen
machine. They expect sales to increase over the next five years. They also expect (hope) that in two years
they will need to buy a second silk screen machine to keep up with the demand for products of their
growing company. Which depreciation method makes more sense for Liam: higher expenses in the first few
years or keeping expenses consistent over time? Or would it be better for them to think not in terms of
time, but rather in the usage of the machine?
Double-Declining-Balance Depreciation
The double-declining-balance depreciation method is the most complex of the three methods because it
accounts for both time and usage and takes more expense in the first few years of the asset’s life. Double
declining considers time by determining the percentage of depreciation expense that would exist under
straight-line depreciation. To calculate this, divide 100 percent by the estimated life in years. For example, a
five-year asset would be 100/5, or 20 percent a year. A four-year asset would be 100/4, or 25 percent a year.
Next, because assets are typically more efficient and are used more heavily early in their life span, the double-
1184 • Accrual Accounting Process
Access for free at openstax.org

declining method takes usage into account by doubling the straight-line percentage. For a four-year asset,
multiply 25 percent, or 50 percent. For a five-year asset, multiply 20 percent
, or 40 percent.
One unique feature of the double-declining-balance method is that in the first year, the estimated salvage
value is not subtracted from the total asset cost before calculating the first year’s depreciation expense.
Instead, the total cost is multiplied by the calculated percentage. However, depreciation expense is not
permitted to take the book value below the estimated salvage value, as demonstrated inFigure 4.15.
Figure4.15Depreciation Expense, Accumulated Depreciation, and Book Value, Years 1–5
Notice that in year four, the remaining book value of $12,528 was not multiplied by 40 percent. This is because
the expense would have been $5,011.20, and since we cannot depreciate the asset below the estimated
salvage value of $10,000, the expense cannot exceed $2,528, which is the amount left to depreciate (difference
between the book value of $12,528 and the salvage value of $10,000). Since the asset has been depreciated to
its salvage value at the end of year four, no depreciation can be taken in year five.
In our example, the first year’s double-declining-balance depreciation expense would be
. For the remaining years, the double-declining percentage is multiplied by the
remaining book value of the asset. Liam would continue to depreciate the asset until the book value and the
estimated salvage value are the same (in this case, $10,000). The net effect of the differences in straight-line
depreciation versus double-declining-balance depreciation is that under the double-declining-balance method,
the allowable depreciation expenses are greater in the earlier years than those allowed for straight-line
depreciation. However, over the depreciable life of the asset, the total depreciation expense taken will be the
same no matter which method the entity chooses. In the current example, both straight-line and double-
declining-balance depreciation will provide a total depreciation expense of $48,000 over its five-year
depreciable life.

(straight-line and double-declining balance) annual depreciation expense is different, after five years the total
amount depreciated (accumulated depreciation) is the same. This occurs because at the end of the asset’s
useful life, it was expected to be worth $10,000: thus, both methods depreciated the asset’s value by $48,000
over that time period.

When analyzing depreciation, accountants are required to make a supportable estimate of an asset’s useful
life and its salvage value. However, “management teams typically fail to invest either time or attention into
making or periodically revisiting and revising reasonably supportable estimates of asset lives or salvage
values, or the selection of depreciation methods, as prescribed by GAAP.”
5
This failure is not an ethical
approach to properly accounting for the use of assets.
Accountants need to analyze depreciation of an asset over the entire useful life of the asset. As an asset
supports the cash flow of the organization, expensing its cost needs to be allocated, not just recorded as an
arbitrary calculation. An asset’s depreciation may change over its life according to its use. If asset depreciation
is arbitrarily determined, the recorded “gains or losses on the disposition of depreciable property assets seen
in financial statements”
6
are not true best estimates. Due to operational changes, the depreciation expense
needs to be periodically reevaluated and adjusted.
Any mischaracterization of asset usage is not proper GAAP and is not proper accrual accounting. Therefore,
“financial statement preparers, as well as their accountants and auditors, should pay more attention to the
quality of depreciation-related estimates and their possible mischaracterization and losses of credits and
charges to operations as disposal gains.”
7
An accountant should always follow GAAP guidelines and allocate
the expense of an asset according to its usage.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Ethical Considerations: How WorldCom’s Improper Capitalization of Costs Almost Shut Down the Internet
In 2002, telecommunications giantWorldComfiled for the largestChapter 11 bankruptcyto date, a
situation resulting from manipulation of its accounting records.
8
At the time, WorldCom operated nearly a
third of the bandwidth of the 20 largest USinternetbackbone routes, connecting over 3,400 global
networks that serviced more than 70,000 businesses in 114 countries.
9
WorldCom used a number of accounting gimmicks to defraud investors, mainly including capitalizing costs
that should have been expensed. Under normal circumstances, this might have been considered just
another accounting fiasco leading to the end of a company. However, WorldCom controlled a large
percentage of backbone routes, a major component of the hardware supporting the internet, as even the
Securities and Exchange Commission recognized. If such an event were to happen today, it could shut
down international commerce and would be considered a national emergency.
10
As demonstrated by
WorldCom, the unethical behavior of a few accountants could have shut down the world’s online
businesses and international commerce. An accountant’s job is fundamental and important: keep
businesses operating in a transparent fashion.

4.5What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Outline the components necessary to calculate profit or loss.
•Contrast revenue and gains versus expenses and losses.
•Differentiate revenue and expense versus receipt or payment of cash.
It’s a common misconception that if a business has cash they are making a profit, and if they are suffering a
loss they must not have any cash. While this could be true, it’s not necessarily true. In this section you’ll
explore key differences between cash flow, revenue, expense, profits, and losses.
Calculating Profit and Loss
Net income (net loss) is determined by comparing revenues and expenses. Net income is a result of revenues
(inflows) being greater than expenses (outflows). A net loss occurs when expenses (outflows) are greater than
revenues (inflows). In accounting it is common to present net income in the following format:
Recall that revenue is the value of goods and services a business provides to its customers and increases the
value of the business. Expenses, on the other hand, are the costs of providing the goods and services and
decrease the value of the business. When revenues exceed expenses, companies have net income. This means
the business has been successful at earning revenues, containing expenses, or a combination of both. If, on
the other hand, expenses exceed revenues, companies experience a net loss. This means the business was

unsuccessful in earning adequate revenues, sufficiently containing expenses, or a combination of both. While
businesses work hard to avoid net loss situations, it is not uncommon for a company to sustain a net loss from
time to time. It is difficult, however, for businesses to remain viable while experiencing net losses over the long
term.
Shown as a formula, the net income (loss) function is:
To be complete, we must also consider the impact of gains and losses. While gains and losses are infrequent in
a business, it is not uncommon that a business would present a gain and/or loss in its financial statements.
Recall that gains are similar to revenue and losses are similar to expenses. Therefore, the traditional
accounting format would be as shown inFigure 4.17.
Figure4.17Gains and Losses
Shown as a formula, the net income (loss) function, including gains and losses, is:
When assessing a company’s net income, it is important to understand the source of the net income.
Businesses strive to attain “high quality” net income (earnings). High-quality earnings are based on
sustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called
temporary earnings. Recall that revenues represent the ongoing value of goods and services the business
provides (sells) to its customers, while gains are infrequent and involve items ancillary to the primary purpose
of the business. For example, assume a bakery sells the truck it uses to deliver wedding cakes and experiences
a gain on the sale. The bakery is not in the business of buying and selling trucks. It is in the baked goods
business. Thus, the gain on the sale of the truck would be ancillary to the primary purpose of the business and
represent a gain rather than revenue. We should use caution if a business attains a significant portion of its
net income as a result of gains rather than revenues. Likewise, net losses derived as a result of losses should
be put into the proper perspective due to the infrequent nature of losses. While net losses are undesirable for
any reason, net losses that result from expenses related to ongoing operations, rather than losses that are
infrequent, are more concerning for the business.
Profit versus Cash Flow
Knowing the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting is necessary to understand the
need for the statement of cash flows. Stakeholders need to know the financial performance (as measured by
the income statement—that is, net income or net loss) and financial position (as measured by the balance
sheet—that is, assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity) of the business. This information is provided in the
income statement, statement of owner’s equity, and balance sheet. However, since these financial statements
are prepared using accrual accounting, stakeholders do not have a clear picture of the business’s cash
activities. The statement of cash flows solves this inadequacy by specifically focusing on the cash inflows and
cash outflows. It also helps better delineate the difference between revenues and cash flow in versus expenses
and cash flow out. As mentioned in prior sections, revenue can occur without cash actually flowing. For
1224 • Accrual Accounting Process

example, a customer may buy a good on account. Revenues would be recorded, but cash would not yet be
received. The same is true on the expenses side. An expense can be incurred, such as an electric bill, but cash
may not have been paid out yet. Thus, an expense is recorded and recognized on the income statement, but
cash has not yet been given up. The statement of cash flows helps reconcile the difference between net
income (a result of recorded revenues and expenses) and actual cash flow.
4.5 • What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?123

Summary
4.1Cash versus Accrual Accounting
Cash-basis accounting records revenues and expenses only when cash is received or distributed. Accrual-basis
accounting, on the other hand, records revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred rather than
waiting until cash changes hands. Most publicly traded companies are required by the SEC to use accrual-basis
accounting. Generally, smaller businesses that deal primarily in cash are the best candidates for using the cash
basis since the accrual method more accurately depicts net income or net loss each period.
4.2Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting
Double-entry accounting means that each time a transaction is recorded, there are at minimum two accounts
impacted by the entry. Each entry’s debits must total its credits in order to support and maintain the balance
in the accounting equation. The accounting equation is expressed as
4.3How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?
In accrual accounting, the timing of revenues (when to record them) is governed by the revenue recognition
principle. The principle indicates that revenue is only recognized on the income statement once it is earned.
This means goods or services must have been delivered or rendered. Expenses, on the other hand, are guided
by the expense recognition principle, which dictates that expenses must be recorded in the period in which
they are incurred.
4.4When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?
Determining when an item is actually an expense depends on whether it is capitalized (a fixed asset) or not.
Fixed assets are those that are of significant value and last longer than one year. The cost of fixed assets is
capitalized (placed on the balance sheet as an asset) and expensed over the useful life of the asset by
recording depreciation. Depreciation can be calculated using straight-line, double-declining-balance, or units-
of-production methods.
4.5What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?
Profit or loss for a company is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. The result is a profit if
revenues are larger than expenses. Profit (or loss) is the money earned from the day-to-day general business
operations. Gains and losses, on the other hand, occur when the business does something they don’t normally
do (like sell a piece of their equipment) and earns or loses money on the transaction. It’s key to note that the
timing of cash flows can vary from the timing of recording revenues or expenses. Thus a revenue does not
necessarily equal cash in, and an expense does not necessarily equal a cash flow out.

Why It Matters
People say that accounting is the “language of business.” Using the language of business, accountants are
able to communicate the financial performance and health of a firm via four key financial statements. These
statements are the income statement, balance sheet, statement of owner’s equity, and statement of cash
flows. Each statement provides different insights into a firm’s performance and financial health. Though some
users may favor one or two statements over another, they are best used together to get a full picture.
In this chapter, you’ll be introduced to a firm calledClear Lake Sporting Goods. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a
small merchandising company (a company that buys finished goods and sells them to consumers) that sells
hunting and fishing gear. It needs financial statements to understand its profitability and current financial
position, manage cash flow, and communicate its finances to outside parties like investors, governing bodies,
and lenders. We will walk through each financial statement, its components, how they are connected, and how
financial statement users understand each one.

5.1The Income Statement
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Outline the purpose and importance of the income statement.
•Identify the structure and key elements of the income statement.
•Discuss the use of EBITDA as a measure of a company’s profit.
Financial information flows from one financial statement to the next. Thus, the statements are prepared in a
specific order. The first statement prepared is the income statement.
Functionality of the Income Statement
Theincome statementshows a firm’s performance over a specific period of time. The statement helps
financial statement users understand the sales generated during the period and theexpensesincurred to
generate those sales. If the expenses are smaller than the sales, the net result is profitability, or net income,
rather than a netloss.
Breaking the income statement down into smaller pieces provides a more transparent view of the firm’s
performance, allowing users to see more clearly what areas of the business incurred expenses. This is helpful
to management in driving improvements and to outside users in assessing performance.
Sales and Gross Profit
The first section of the income statement begins with sales. Though financial statements are required to follow
a certain format, account names can differ slightly from one firm to another. You may see the first line, often
referred to asthe top line, calledsales,sales revenue,revenue,service revenues, and other similar titles. All of
these titles are meant to reflect the sales generated by selling product to customers in the day-to-day
business. On Clear Lake’s income statement inFigure 5.2, we see its top line referred to as Sales.
Income from items that aren’t common to the firm’s day-to-day business are reported asgainsand losses,
and they are reported further down in the income statement rather than at the top line with its regular, core
business activities. This is to ensure that anomalies like selling a machine or a loss on retiring a bond don’t
mislead financial statement users as to the general performance of the firm and impact their assumptions of
future results.
Firms report their sales and any reductions to sales separately on the income statement. They begin with
gross sales, which includes all sales to customers. Clear Lake reported gross sales of $105,000 last year and
$126,000 this year. The next line is sales returns and allowances, which is deducted from gross sales in order to
find net sales. Clear Lake’s sales returns and allowances were $5,000 and $6,000 respectively, leaving the
company with net sales of $100,000 and $120,000 respectively
Next, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is deducted from net sales in order to arrive at gross profit. (It is
customary to refer to sales minus COGS as gross profit because gross margingross profit/sales.) Cost of
goods sold includes the costs directly involved in making the product that was sold during the period.
Common examples of costs included in cost of goods sold include direct labor, direct materials, and the
overhead assigned to the product in production. For a service business, this would include its direct labor and
any materials used to deliver its services. For a retail firm like Clear Lake Sporting Goods, this would include
the costs of all the goods it purchased for resale. Clear Lake’s COGS is seen at $50,000 and $60,000 for the
prior and current years. Note that different types of companies will have different types of costs deducted in
their Cost of Goods section. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a retailer, or merchandiser that buys good to resell.
Their cost of goods includes the cost of goods they purchased to resell. In the link to learning, you will explore
Apple, a technology manufacturer. Their cost of goods would include the cost to manufacture the goods they
1305 • Financial Statements

sell. Another type of firm is a service firm. A law office, for example, would include primarily the cost of labor in
their cost of services.
Gross profit is a reflection of how profitable the firm’s performance was in its core business function. It
includes only the core business and direct costs of performing that business. If the company were a shoe
company, gross profit would show how profitable the company was in simply making the shoes it sold. If it
were a bakery, gross profit would show how profitable the company was in simply baking the goods it sold.
Gross profit shows financial statement users how effective the business is at generating top-line profits on
their core business function. It does not reflect the performance of other areas of the firm such as other
operating costs to support the direct production process, indirect costs, and financing.
For Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we see its gross profit inFigure 5.2. The company earned $50,000 of gross
profitthe prior year and $60,000 in the current year.

net sales for the last few years. What can you learn about the company’s recent performance in the area of
sales? Is the gross sales line improving? How about the sales returns and allowances line? Has it improved
or declined or simply changed incrementally with gross sales?
Review the firm’s gross profit for the past few years. Has it improved or declined? Consider the company’s
improvement (or decline) in gross sales as compared to the improvement or decline in gross profit. Does it
reflect any change in performance over time (earning more or less gross profit on its gross sales)?
Income from Operations
Gross profit is a very helpful measure, but it is only the first of several provided by the income statement. After
gross profit is calculated, other operating expenses are deducted in order to calculate the firm’s income from
operations, also commonly called operating income. Common operating costs found in this section include
building rent and utilities, property taxes, wages and salaries, and other overhead costs. InFigure 5.3, we can
see Clear Lake’s operating expenses. To sell its hunting and fishing equipment in the current year, Clear Lake
Sporting Goods paid rent for its building ($5,500) and utilities for its retail and warehouse spaces ($2,500);
recordeddepreciationon equipment, buildings, and store furnishings (shelves, racks, etc.) ($3,600); and paid
salaries to its indirect employees in accounting, purchasing, and human resources ($5,400). The company’s
operating expenses are deducted from gross profit to arrive at operating income
While gross profit reflects only how profitable the firm was in making its core product, operating income
5.1 • The Income Statement131

reflects how profitable the firm’s daily operations were as a whole. This still does not include other
miscellaneous items outside the scope of a firm’s normal business. Just as the name implies, it shows income
from the core operations of the firm.
Figure5.3Income Statement through Income from Operations
We can see that the company was able to generatemore in net sales in the
current year than the prior year. However, it only generatedin gross profit and
of additional operating income. Further investigation shows that while net sales
increased, so did the direct costs of its goods (COGS) and its operating expenses.
We will further explore how to assess each of these expenses later in the chapter using common-size analysis.
Common-size analysis reflects each element of a financial statement as a percentage of the base. In the case
of the income statement, the base is net sales. Here we would see that COGS was 50 percent of net sales in
both the currentand prior year, indicating there wasn’t any significant
change in performance we could detect from the information provided in the income statement.

Based on the improvement or decline in operating income, review Apple’s operating expenses to
investigate. Have any of the operating expenses changed significantly? How did that impact the company’s
operating income? What might it tell you about the company’s performance?
Net Income
Finally, we move on tonet income, or what is commonly referred to asthe bottom line. Net income (or loss)
reflects the net impact of all financial transactions for the firm, including those that are caused by events
outside the normal course of business. The most common items deducted from operating income to arrive at
net income include interest expense, gains/losses, and income tax expense. Remember, gains and losses are
those that result from unusual transactions outside the normal course of business. Examples include selling a
piece of old equipment or a loss on retiring debt.
We can see inFigure 5.4that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has outstanding debt, so it incurred interest expense

of $2,000 in the current year and $3,000 the prior year. Since it recorded net income (not a loss), it must also
record income tax expense of $6,000 in the current and $5,000 in the prior year.

EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)
Now that we have a full income statement, we can look at another commonly used measure of financial
performance called EBITDA.EBITDAstands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
Amortization is similar to depreciation. It is the spreading of the cost of an intangible asset over the course of
its useful life. Intangible assets are long-term assets that lack physical substance, such as patents and
copyrights.
Since EBITDA removes noncash items from the net income equation, it is considered a useful measure in
assessing the cash flows provided by operating activities. We will assess cash flows using thestatement of
cash flowsand various other cash flow measures later in this chapter as well.

5.2The Balance Sheet
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Outline the purpose and importance of the balance sheet.
•Identify the structure and key elements of the balance sheet.
The Accounting Equation and the Classified Balance Sheet
Recall that the income statement shows the performance of a firm over the course of time. The classified
balance sheet shows the financial state of a company as of a specific point in time. It is a key distinction
between the two statements. The classified balance sheet is prepared in sections that align with the
accounting equation.
Remember, theaccounting equationreflects theassets(items owned by the organization) and how they
were obtained (by incurringliabilitiesor provided by owners). Liabilities are debts owed to other parties.
Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.
The classified balance sheet is thus broken down into three sections; assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity. If
1345 • Financial Statements
Access for free at openstax.org

prepared correctly, the total assets on the balance sheet equals the total liabilities and owner’s equity sections
of the balance sheet.
The classified balance sheet is considered or termedclassifiedwhen the assets and liabilities within the
balance sheet are grouped into even smaller sections: current and noncurrent (seeFigure 5.6). Both assets
and liabilities are broken down on the balance sheet into current and noncurrent classifications in order to
provide more detail and transparency as well as abide by the convention of reporting in descending order of
liquidity.Current assetsare those that can be used or converted to cash within a year. Common examples of
current assets include cash, inventory, accounts receivable, and short-term investments. Assets that will be in
use longer than a year are considered noncurrent. Common examples ofnoncurrent assetsinclude notes
receivable, machinery and equipment, buildings, and land.
Just as we noted a few key differences in the income statements based on the type of firm, you may also notice
a few slight differences in the balance sheet depending on the firm type. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a
retailer. Thus, you will see that their inventory for resale on their balance sheet is simply called “Inventory.”
This is the goods they have purchased for resale but have not yet sold. A manufacturer, like Apple, Inc. in the
Link to Learning sections, will have a variety of inventory types including raw materials, work in progress, and
finished goods inventory. These represent the various states of the inventory (ready to use, partially complete,
and fully completed product). A service firm, on the other hand, may not have inventory at all. If it does, it may
be simple goods it uses to help deliver its service. For example, a cleaning company may keep an inventory of
cleaning supplies.
Figure5.6Graphical Representation of the Accounting EquationBoth assets and liabilities are categorized as current and
noncurrent.
Clear Lake Sporting Goods has cash, accounts receivable, inventory, short-term investments, and equipment.
It rents its facilities, so it has no buildings on its balance sheets. Of all its assets, only the equipment is long
term. The assets section for Clear Lake’s classified balance sheet is shown inFigure 5.7.

5.2 • The Balance Sheet135

does the company have? What types of noncurrent assets does it have? How has the total of each type of
asset changed over time?
Solution:
Apple reports cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, vendor
non-trade receivables, and “other” current assets on its balance sheet. The company’s current assets
decreased from $162,819 in 2019 to $143,713 in 2020. Apple reports marketable securities, property, plant
and equipment, and other noncurrent assets in the noncurrent asset section of its balance sheet. The
company’s noncurrent assets increased from $175,697 in 2019 to $180,175 in 2020. (Amounts are in
millions.)
We’ve covered the assets side of the accounting equation; now let’s turn our attention to the other side of the
equation and the other two sections of the balance sheet: liabilities and equity. Just like the assets section, the
liabilities section is broken down between current and noncurrent.Current liabilitiesare those that will be
due within a year. Common examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, wages payable, and
unearned revenue.Noncurrent liabilitiesare those that are due more than a year into the future. Notes
payable is a common noncurrent liability.
Clear Lake Sporting Goods has accounts payable and has collected payments from a few customers that it
hasn’t yet shipped its product to (unearned revenue). It also owes money on a note payable. Its accounts
payable and unearned revenue are both current liabilities. The note payable is not due for several years, thus
making it a noncurrent liability (seeFigure 5.8).

The stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet for corporations contains two primary categories of
accounts. The first is contributed capital, which is funds paid in by owners. The second category is earned

capital, which is funds earned by the corporation as part of business operations. On the balance sheet,
retained earningsis a key component of the earned capital section, while the stock accounts such as common
stock, preferred stock, and additional paid-in capital are the primary components of the contributed capital
section.
Clear Lake Sporting Goods has just one contributed capital account—common stock—and one earned capital
account—retained earnings. The equity section of its balance sheet is shown inFigure 5.9.

Solution:
Apple’s total assets for 2020 were $323,888, and its total liabilities and equity were also $323,888. (Amounts
are in millions.)
Importance of the Balance Sheet
Now that we have gone to all the work to carefully assemble a classified balance sheet, what do we use it for?
The answer lies within the accounting equation itself. Think of the accounting equation from a “sources and
claims” perspective. Under this approach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by
incurring liabilities or were provided by owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by
creditors and/or owners. The balance sheet shows us what the firm has (its assets), who owns them (equity),
and who the firm owes (its liabilities).
Limitations of the Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is indeed a very helpful financial statement, but it also poses challenges. First, assets on the
balance sheet, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), are recorded at historical cost.
Historical cost is simply the cost paid for the item at the time it was purchased. Changes in market value of big-
ticket items like land or buildings are not reflected in the balance sheet. Land remains at historical cost, and
depreciable items like buildings are reflected at their current book value (historical cost less accumulated
depreciation). If the asset has appreciated over time, the higher market value of the assets would not be seen
on the balance sheet.
Estimates are another limitation of the balance sheet. Items on the balance sheet such as allowance for
doubtful accounts and allowance for bad debt are based on estimates. The useful lives for calculating
depreciation is another common estimate. If these estimates are incorrect, the net value of the asset can be
under- or overstated.
Another key limitation is the fact that a balance sheet reflects balances at only one given point in time. This
5.2 • The Balance Sheet137

means that the account value could have been quite different on the day before or the day after the date of
the balance sheet. For example, if a firm were concerned with certain ratios or investor/lender expectations of
its cash balance, it could choose to not pay several vendor payments in the last week of December. Thus, on
December 31, the firm reflects a high cash balance on its balance sheet. However, by the end of the first week
of January, it has caught up on late vendor payments and again shows a low cash balance.
Finally, there are many possible things of value that are not recorded on the balance sheet. Internally
generated assets and the firm’s human capital are two common examples. Internally generated assets can be
anything from a website, a process, to an idea.
5.3The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Identify connected elements between the balance sheet and the income statement.
•Differentiate between expenses and payables.
Net Income and Retained Earnings
As mentioned earlier, the financial statements are linked by certain elements and thus must be prepared in a
certain order. The income statement was first since net income (or loss) is a required figure in preparing the
balance sheet. During the period close process, all temporary accounts are closed to the income summary
account, which is then closed to retained earnings. All revenue and expense accounts are closed since they are
temporary. The net result is either net profit or net loss as the balance in the income summary account.
Remember that the retained earnings account reflects all income the firm has earned since its inception less
anydividendspaid out to shareholders. Thus the result (net income) of the income statement feeds the
retained earnings account on the balance sheet. Retained earnings is also an element of the statement of
stockholders’ equity, which we will cover later in this chapter.
InFigure 5.10, we see net income in the current year of $35,000, which was added to the company’s prior year
retained earnings balance of $15,000. Notice, however, that the prior year balance was $15,000, and the
current year balance is only $20,000. It does not total $50,000 as we might have expected.
Remember, retained earnings represents all earnings since inception less any dividends paid out. Clear Lake
Sporting Goods must have paid out $30,000 in dividends in the current year. We will see this information laid
out in the statement of retained earnings. In the prior year they began with a $10,000 balance in retained
earnings. Income of $30,000 increased retained earnings and dividends paid back out to investors reduced
retained earnings, leaving an ending balance in the prior year of $15,000. This rolls over and is the beginning
balance for the current year. In the current year Clear Lake had net income of $35,000 and paid $30,000 of
their earnings out to shareholders, essentially resulting in a $5,000 increase to the retained earnings account.
Figure5.10Statement of Retained Earnings
Now we can see the full flow of information from the income statement to the statement of retained earnings
(Figure 5.10) and finally to the balance sheet. Clear Lake’s net income flows from the income statement into
1385 • Financial Statements

retained earnings, which is reflected on the statement of retained earnings. The balance in retained earnings
is then reflected on the balance sheet. This flow is depicted inFigure 5.11.

net income for the most recent year? What is the amount of retained earnings on the balance sheet for the
current and prior years? Does it appear the company paid out dividends this year?
5.3 • The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement139

Expenses versus Payables
There is another key relationship between the income statement and the balance sheet can often be confusing
to non-accountants: an expense versus a payable. The two are often assumed to be the same thing. However,
it is important to note that the two are distinctly different.
Let’s look at an example to outline the key differences. Clear Lake Sporting Goods incurred utility expenses
during the current period (electric and gas). Its utilities totaled $1,500. In the month that followed, the utilities
vendor sent an invoice for $1,500. Clear Lake has incurred an expense. It will reflect an expense of $1,500 on
the income statement for the utilities expense. This is the income statement impact of the transaction. So is it
safe to assume that because Clear Lake has an expense, it also used cash? Not necessarily. Or is it safe to
assume that if the company has an expense, it is the same as a payable? Again, the answer is no.
Remember, the accounting equation rests on the foundation of the double-entry accounting system. This
means that every transaction has two sides: a debit and a credit. They must be equal. When Clear Lake records
an expense of $1,500, it must also record the other half of that transaction. In this case, the company incurred
utilities expenses throughout the period “on account,” which means it records an increase in their accounts
payable. When the invoice comes due, another transaction must then be recorded to reduce accounts payable
and reduce cash. Accounts payable is a liability found on the balance sheet, normally a current liability. The
expense incurred caused the payable, but it is distinctly separate from the payable (seeFigure 5.12).

5.4The Statement of Owner’s Equity
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain the concept of owner’s equity.
•Outline the purpose and importance of the statement of owner’s equity.
•Identify the structure and key elements of the statement of owner’s equity.
What Is Equity?
Recall that the accounting equation can help us see what is owned (assets), who is owed (liabilities), and finally
who the owners are (equity). The statement of owner’s equity addresses the last segment of the accounting
equation in detail by laying out the equity elements of the firm and highlighting changes in these elements
throughout the period.
Equity represents the ownership of the firm. The stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet for
corporations contains two primary categories of accounts. The first is paid-in capital or contributed
capital—consisting of amounts paid in by owners. The second category is earned capital, consisting of
amounts earned by the corporation as part of business operations. On the balance sheet, retained earnings is
a key component of the earned capital section, while the stock accounts such as common stock, preferred
stock, and additional paid-in capital are the primary components of the contributed capital section.
Common stock represents ownership in the firm. Common stockholders normally have voting rights.
Preferred stock has unique rights that are “preferred,” or more advantageous, to shareholders than common
stock. Unlike common stockholders, preferred shareholders typically do not have voting rights and do not
share in the common stock dividend distributions. Instead, the “preferred” classification entitles shareholders
to a dividend that is fixed (assuming sufficient dividends are declared). Treasury stock is shares that were
outstanding and have been repurchased by the firm but not retired. Thus they are still issued, but not
outstanding. Additional paid-in capital is the difference between the issue price and par value of the common
stock. For example, if a firm issued and sold stock at a market price of $20 that had a $5 par value, $5 for each
share would be recorded into common stock and the excess $15 per share would be recorded into the
additional paid-in capital account.
If we review the balance sheet for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we see just two elements of equity: common
stock and retained earnings. Common stock in the prior year was $75,000 and increased to $80,000 in the
current year, indicating Clear Lake issued additional common stock (seeFigure 5.13).

Solution:
Apple reports common stock, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income.
Distributions to Owners
When firms earn a profit, they have two options as to what to do with their earnings. They can keep (retain)
them and reinvest them back into the business, or they can pay them out to their shareholders in the form of
dividends. Dividends are commonly in the form of cash, but dividends can be paid out in the form of stock or
other assets as well.
To pay a cash dividend, the firm must have enough cash on hand and sufficient retained earnings. They cannot
pay out a dividend beyond the retained earnings available. Some companies issue shares of stock as a
dividend rather than cash or property. This often occurs when the company has insufficient cash but wants to
keep its investors happy. When a company issues a stock dividend, it distributes additional shares of stock to
existing shareholders.
A property dividend occurs when the firm pays out dividends in the form of something other than stock or
cash, often one of their assets or something they hold in inventory. For example,Walt Disney Companymay
choose to distribute tickets to visit its theme parks. A property dividend may be declared when a company
wants to reward its investors but doesn’t have the cash to distribute, or if it needs to hold on to its existing
cash for other investments.
Remember, the retained earnings account reflects the cumulative earnings of a firm since they began
business, less dividends paid out to shareholders. This includes all forms of dividends (cash, stock, and other
assets). Note that dividends are distributed or paid only to shares of stock that are outstanding. Treasury
shares are not outstanding, so no dividends are declared or distributed for these shares. Regardless of the
type of dividend, the declaration always causes a decrease in the retained earnings account.

annually, pending approval by the board.
Elements of the Statement of Owner’s Equity
Now that we have covered the basic elements of equity and know what dividends are, we have the basic pieces
we need to create the statement ofowner’s equity. The statement is broken out into columns, one for each
element of equity: common stock, preferred stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, and treasury
stock.
The first line of the statement provides the balance of each segment as of the first day of the period. Each
1425 • Financial Statements

following line provides information on any events during the period that changed the value of any of the
accounts. Common examples of events found on the statement include net income or loss for the period,
issuing common or preferred stock, purchasing or selling treasury stock, and declaring a dividend.
Clear Lake Sporting Goods has just common stock and retained earnings to report in their statement of
owner’s equity. They had just two events to report in their statement that impacted their equity accounts; they
reported net income and they issued dividends (seeFigure 5.14).

5.5The Statement of Cash Flows
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Outline the purpose and importance of the statement of cash flows.
•Identify the structure and key elements of the statement of cash flows.
The final financial statement is the statement of cash flows. It is a crucial statement, as it shows the sources of
and uses of cash for the firm during the accounting period. Remember, under accrual accounting, transactions
are recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. Thus, the income statement does not provide
all the insights necessary to understand a firm’s cash flows. To fully understand the firm’s flow of cash, the
statement of cash flows is needed.
Importance of the Statement of Cash Flows
Remember, most firms use accrual accounting. Revenues and expenses are recorded when they occur, not
necessarily when cash moves. This can create timing differences between profits and cash flows. A firm can be
profitable and still not have an adequate flow of cash. The opposite is also true: it can experience a net loss
and still have cash on hand. Earning a profit is wonderful, but it is not the only goal an organization has. It
must also have adequate cash flow to support daily operations. To support cash planning and to provide
external financial statement users such as lenders and investors information about the firm’s cash flow, the
statement of cash flows is prepared. Cash flow is also a crucial metric for determining the value of a company.
External financial statement users also rely on the statement of cash flows to help them evaluate the quality of
the firm’s earnings. Users compare earnings to cash flow to assess the validity of the earnings data. For
example, a firm reporting a strong profit but very little cash flow might raise some questions as to what was
recorded to drive profits that isn’t also driving cash flows.
The statement of cash flows also helps external users determine the driving forces behind the firm’s cash
flows. They can see if cash is generated primarily by daily operations or if cash is being generated or
5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows143

consumed by events outside the firm’s normal course of business.
There are two key methods of preparing the statement: direct and indirect.FASB (Financial Accounting
Standards Board)favors thedirect method. Despite that, the most common method used by far in general
practice is theindirect method. The direct method lists cash flows directly from revenues and expenses,
whereas the indirect method reconciles income to cash flows. The indirect method begins with net income and
reconciles each account in order to arrive at net cash flow. It essentially reconcilesaccrual basisaccounting to
cash basis, or cash flow.
Operating Activities
To provide clear information about what areas of the business generated and used cash, the statement of cash
flows is broken down into three key categories: operating, financing, and investing. The operating section
reflects cash flows generated by and used by the day-to-day operations of the business. Investing activities
include investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself (items like machinery, land, or other
fixed assets). Finally, financing activities are those used to provide funds to run the business (loans, interest).
As mentioned, operating activities are those that are used or generated by the day-to-day operations of the
firm. The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows begins with net income. All lines
thereafter, in that section, are then adjustments to reconcile net income to actual cash flows by adding back
noncash expenseslike depreciation and adjusting for changes in asset and liability accounts. For example,
depreciation is a noncash expense. Thus, depreciation is added back to net income.
To prepare the statement of cash flows for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we need the beginning cash balance
from the balance sheet, net income and depreciation expense from the income statement, and a set of
comparative balance sheets to see the change in asset and liability accounts (seeFigure 5.15).
1445 • Financial Statements
Access for free at openstax.org

Figure5.15Comparative Income Statements and Balance Sheets
Clear Lake’s statement of cash flows begins with the current year net income of $35,000 from the income
statement. Next, noncash expenses are deducted. Clear Lake’s only noncash expense on their current year
income statement is depreciation of $3,600. Since deprecation is an expense that reduces income but is not
actually paid out in cash in the current period, it must be added back to net income to reconcile net income to
cash flow.
Next, changes in operational assets and liabilities are used to continue reconciling net income to actual cash
flow. For example, Clear Lake’s accounts receivable increased from the prior period to the current period. This
means that there were more sales recorded but not yet received in cash in this period than there were in the
prior period, making an increase in accounts receivable a reduction on the statement. Inventory increased,
which means additional cash was spent to acquire it, making it a use of cash or reduction to net income to
move closer to cash. Accounts payable and unearned revenue, both liability accounts, increased. Since these
are liabilities, an increase would indicate that the liability was incurred but not as quickly paid out; thus it is an
increase to the statement.
Tallying all these adjustments to net income shows Clear Lake’s net cash flows provided by operating activities
of $53,600 (seeFigure 5.16).
5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows145

Figure5.16Operating Activities Section of the Statement of Cash Flows
Investing Activities
As mentioned, investing activities include investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself
(items like machinery, land, or other fixed assets). These are items that are capitalized (placed on the balance
sheet and depreciated over time) and thus did not reduce net income. They did, however, cause an impact to
cash flow (seeFigure 5.17).
During the current year, Clear Lake purchased an additional $5,000 in short-term investments (see the
comparative balances sheets; the balance in that account increased by $5,000 since the prior year). They also
purchased additional plant assets in the amount of $13,600. This amount can be figured by comparing the
difference in the current and prior plant assets accounts and including the impact of current year depreciation
($50,000 current year balance less $40,000 prior year balance and $3,600 of depreciation = $13,600 of new
assets purchased).
Figure5.17Investing Activities Section of the Statement of Cash Flows
Financing Activities
Recall that financing activities are those used to provide funds to run the business. Common items in this
section of the statement include the payment of dividends, issuance of common or preferred stock, and
issuance or payment of notes payable (seeFigure 5.18).
In the current year, Clear Lake took out additional notes payable (a cash inflow). We can see this by the
increase in their notes payable account from the prior year to current year ($40,000 to $50,000). This is an
inflow of cash and thus an increase on the statement. Dividends of $30,000 were paid to shareholders (found
on the statement of retained earnings and the statement of owner’s equity). Finally, we see that Clear Lake
must have issued additional common stock, as their common stock balance increased from $75,000 to $80,000.

The final task to wrap up the statement of cash flows is to tally net cash generated or used by summing all
three sections. This amount is then used to adjust the beginning cash balance from the balance sheet.
Assuming the statement was prepared correctly, the sum should equal the ending cash balance on the
balance sheet.
In the full statement, we can see that Clear Lake has net cash flow of $20,000. The beginning cash balance was
$90,000, making the ending cash balance $110,000 (seeFigure 5.19).
Figure5.19Full Statement of Cash Flows
Analyzing Performance
The statement of cash flows can be used in a number of ways to assess firm performance by both internal and
external financial statement users. Internal users can assess sources of and uses of cash in order to aid in
adapting, as necessary, to ensure adequate future cash flows. External users also use the statement. Recall
that comparing net income to operational cash flows can help assess the quality of earnings. In the next
section you’ll explore operating cash flow andfree cash flowto the firm, two key points of analysis in

assessing cash flows.
5.6Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate operating cash flow and free cash flow.
•Assess organizational cash management performance.
Operating Cash Flow
Now that we have a statement of cash flows prepared, we can move on to a few key elements of the statement
used to assess organizational cash management performance. Operating cash flow, or net cash flow from
operating activities, is calculated in the first section of the statement of cash flows. It depicts the cash
generated (or used by) the primary business activities. Remember, operating cash flow is calculated under the
indirect method by adjusting net income for noncash expenses like depreciation and adjustments for changes
in current asset and liability accounts (changes in working capital).
Operating cash flow is helpful in assessing organizational cash management performance as it relates to the
core business function—operations. Key management practices in this area can have a profound impact on
the firm’s cash flow. Practices and policies include customer payment terms, collection policies and practices,
and vendor payment terms. Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit
or loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing
operational cash flow.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow (FCF)is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an
important measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed
assets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key
measure of cash flow management practices and a firm’s ability to generate enough cash to cover operations
and capital assets and it shows if there is any left over for other considerations such as dividend payments,
debt repayment, and contributions to increase working capital for future growth.
Using the data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we can calculate its free cash flow as follows:
This means that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has $40,000 of cash available to repay debt or pay cash dividends
after having covered the cash needs of its operations and capital asset investments.
Managing Cash Flow
Managing cash flow is not an easy task. A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,
there are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where
cash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant
impact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite
quickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days
to collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm
will go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but
with no cash flow yet to cover it.
The same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses. Accepting
1485 • Financial Statements
Access for free at openstax.org

net 10 terms requires the firm to give up its cash quickly, while pushing for more favorable terms like net 30 or
net 60 allows the firm to wait much longer to give up its cash.
It is important to assess both sides of cash flow and the impact it has on the firm as well as the customer and
vendor relationships it maintains. Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable
payment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept
shorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer
relationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer
payment terms.
When there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so
financing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for
a firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as
cash flow fluctuates.
Now that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful
in evaluating them: common-size statements. Common-size financial statements, also termed vertical analysis,
restate the financial statement items as a percentage of a base item. Doing so helps reveal relationships
between items, aids in assessing performance over time, and makes it easier to compare one company to
another, regardless of size (thus the name common-size).

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Prepare common-size statements.
•Assess organizational performance using common-size statements.
•Use industry comparisons to assess organizational performance.
Common-Size Income Statements
A common-size income statement is created by restating each line as a percentage of net sales. Expressing
each item on the income statement as a percentage rather than in absolute dollars makes it much easier to
make comparisons, particularly to other divisions or competitors of varying sizes. The formula to calculate
each item on the income statement is:
Using Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ current year income statement, we can see how each line item in it is divided
by net sales in order to assemble a common-size income statement (seeFigure 5.20).

Figure5.20Common-Size Income Statement
It may seem cumbersome to create a common-size statement. However, a simple tool like Microsoft Excel can
be quite handy in making the process easier and faster. The same formula can be copied and replicated in
each income statement line, making the calculations much faster. InFigure 5.21, you can see the formulas
used to create Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ common-size income statement in Excel. Notice that the $ can be
inserted to anchor a cell reference, making it easier to copy and paste the same formula onto many lines or
columns.

Common-Size Balance Sheet
The common-size balance sheet functions much like the common-size income statement. Each line item on the
balance sheet is restated as a percentage of total assets.
Using Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ current balance sheet, we can see how each line item in its statement is
divided by total assets in order to assemble a common-size balance sheet (seeFigure 5.22).

Excel can also be used to create a common-size balance sheet. Once the formula is created, it can be copied
into each line, making the process to create a common-size statement much easier (seeFigure 5.23):

It is important to note that while we have provided two years of data here to explore the process, when
performing analysis for a firm or investment, several years of data are commonly used to provide a better view
of historical performance.
Analyzing Organizational Performance
Common-size financial statements facilitate the analysis of financial performance by converting each element
of the statements to a percentage. This makes it easier to compare figures from one period to the next,
compare departments within an organization, and compare the firm to other companies of any size as well as
industry averages. On the income statement, analysts can see how much of sales revenue is spent on each
type of expense. They can see this breakdown for each firm and compare how different firms function in terms
of expenses, proportionally. They can also look at the percentage for each expense over time to see if they are
spending more or less on certain areas of the business, such as research and development. On the balance
sheet, analysts commonly look to see the percentage of debt and equity to determine capital structure. They
can also quickly see the percentage of current versus noncurrent assets and liabilities.
In Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ common-size income statement for the current and prior years, we can see that
cost of goods as a percentage of sales remained the same (seeFigure 5.24). This means that while sales
1525 • Financial Statements

increased, so did cost of goods sold, but it increased at the same proportion as sales. No improvement or
decline occurred in the company’s cost of goods sold. The same is true for rent, depreciation, and utilities
expenses. One key item did change slightly as a percentage: salaries expense. The 2 percent decrease in
operating income from the prior year’s 38 percent to the current year’s 36 percent was caused by the increase
in salaries expense as a percentage of sales.
Net income, however, only declined by 1 percent from 30 percent in the prior year to 29 percent in the current
year because interest expense dropped by 1 percent, offsetting the 2 percent increase in salaries expense.

operating income, other income, and net income percentages for the current and prior year. What can you
learn about the company’s recent performance in these areas? Has it improved or declined, or has it simply
changed incrementally with gross sales?
On the Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ common-size balance sheet, we see that current assets remained at 80
percent of total assets from the prior to current year (seeFigure 5.25). The mix of current assets that comprise
that 80 percent changed only slightly with a 1 percent decrease in cash, 2 percent increase in accounts
receivable, 2 percent decrease in inventory, and no change in short-term investments. Noncurrent assets
includes only equipment. While the balance in the equipment account did change as a percentage of total
assets, equipment remained the same at 20 percent.
On the debt and equity side of the balance sheet, however, there were a few percentage changes worth
noting. In the prior year, the balance sheet reflected 55 percent debt and 45 percent equity. In the current
year, that balance shifted to 60 percent debt and 40 percent equity. The firm did issue additional stock and
showed an increase in retained earnings, both totaling a $10,000 increase in equity. However, the equity
increase was much smaller than the total increase in liabilities of $40,000. Long-term debt increased by only
$10,000 by issuing additional notes payable. The remainder of that increase is seen in the 5 percent increase in
current liabilities. In that increase, most of it was in unearned revenue.

Industry Comparison
Recall that a key benefit of common-size analysis is comparing the firm’s performance to the industry.
Expressing the figures on the income statement and balance sheet as percentages rather than raw dollar
figures allows for comparison to other companies regardless of size differences.
Clear Lake Sporting Goods, for example, might compare their financial performance on their income
statement to a key competitor, Charlie’s Camping World. Charlie is a much bigger retailer for outdoor gear, as
Charlie has nearly seven times greater sales than Clear Lake. Common-size statements allow Clear Lake to
compare their statements in a meaningful way (seeFigure 5.26). Notice that Clear Lake spends 50 percent of
its sales on cost of goods sold while Charlie spends 59 percent. This is a significant difference that would be an
indicator that Clear Lake and Charlie have key differences in their operations, purchasing policies, or general
performance in their core products.

We know that Charlie is a bigger retailer, and we see this clearly in the rent expense as a percentage of sales.
Charlie spends 11 percent of its sales on building rent, while Clear Lake spends only 5 percent. A clear
difference in performance is hinted at here, alluding to Charlie spending more per square foot on rent or using
its retail space differently, causing it to rent more space for its product per sales dollar than Clear Lake does.
Depreciation expense, though not a large figure, is smaller for Charlie, giving us a hint that Charlie has less
capital equipment than Clear Lake, perhaps tied to the higher rent expense. It is possible that Charlie rents
some of its equipment, which would help explain the higher rent percentage. Finally, Charlie’s salaries
percentage is significantly higher at 12 percent than Clear Lake’s 5 percent. Though the simple percentage
does not tell us why, it does provide us a hint and allow for further questions or investigation. Charlie may pay
its employees a much higher wage than Clear Lake. They may also have far more sales associates on the floor
in their larger spaces than Clear Lake does in their smaller retail spaces.
Note that although we have compared just two years of data for Charlie and Clear Lake, it is more common to
use several years of data to get a more robust view of long-term trends.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Identify the most common types of accounting periods.
•Outline key considerations and accounting principles that dictate the timing of financial reporting.
•Describe the SEC reporting requirements relevant to financial statements.
•Identify the key elements of a company annual report.
Defining Accounting Periods
An accounting period can be any period of time, but the most common accounting periods are months,
quarters, and a year. Accounting periods are important, particularly in accrual accounting, so there are clear
cutoffs for recording transactions.
It is important to note that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles(GAAP)require companies to provide
quarterly financial statements. However, most firms, even those not covered by GAAP, prepare financial
statements monthly in order to provide timely data to their financial statement users both internally and
externally.
Time Period Principle
Providing information to financial statement users in a timely fashion brings us to our next key topic, which is
the time period principle. In order for information to be useful, it must be timely. This means that financial
statement users need to get the statements quickly enough to be able to make relevant decisions with them.
Providing statements on a timely basis is the foundation of the time period accounting principle.
Fiscal versus Calendar Year
Though a firm may present financial statements monthly, quarterly, and annually, not all time periods are
created equal. Firms have the option to choose between a fiscal and a calendar year. The calendar year, which
begins January 1 and ends December 31, is the traditional year we are accustomed to. The calendar year,
however, doesn’t always work well with a firm’s business cycle. Due to seasonality or other factors, a firm may
choose to adopt a fiscal year with their own beginning and end date. For example, a firm may choose to start
its fiscal year on June 1 and end it on May 31. A firm can opt to change from a fiscal to a calendar year or vice
versa but must only do so for a justifiable reason.

provides information on the company’s chosen time period. Does Apple use a fiscal or calendar year?
Solution:
Apple uses a fiscal year. Their fiscal year ended on September 26, 2020.
The Annual Report
An annual report is part of the 10-K filing that publicly traded firms must provide to the SEC and investors each
year. The report details the firm’s operations and performance for the year and its current financial conditions.
The report contains general company information, the firm’s financial statements, notes to the financial

statements, various required disclosures pertaining to accounting policies, themanagement discussion and
analysis (MD&A)statement, a letter from the CEO to the shareholders, and the firm’s audit report.
THINK IT THROUGH
Annual Report Key Elements
Visit theApple, Inc.Annual Report(https://openstax.org/r/2020-doc-financial-annual-report)for 2020 and
review the title of the table of contents on page 1. What key elements would you be drawn to review if you
were a potential investor? In Part II of the table of contents, find the MD&A report (page 20) and use the
table of contents link to navigate to it. What key highlights and challenges did the company report for the
year?
Solution:
Answers may vary. A few key items of note might include risk factors, financial statements, the MD&A letter,
and disclosures about market risk. Apple’s MD&A reported significant updates on the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, a few financial updates, product updates, segment performance data, a conversation
about its debt, contractual obligations, and accounting policies.
SEC Reporting Requirements
TheSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC)requires publicly traded firms to regularly provide several
reports. The two most common are the 10-K and quarterly report (10-Q). Certain unique events also require an
additional filing called an 8-K. There are many events that might require reporting. A few key examples include
changes to rights of shareholders, changes in control of the company, and amendments to the company
charter or bylaws.
The quarterly report is much like the annual report already discussed. It contains the firm’s financial
statements, required accounting disclosures, statements on internal control, and a management discussion
and analysis (MD&A) letter. It does not contain an auditor’s report, as firms are not audited on a quarterly
basis. Quarterly reports are helpful to investors because they provide information on a timely enough basis to
be relevant.

Summary
5.1The Income Statement
The income statement reflects a firm’s performance over a period of time. Most financial statements are
prepared monthly, quarterly, and annually. The income statement reflects sales less cost of goods sold to
arrive at gross profit. Operating costs are deducted to arrive at operating income. Finally, other
nonoperational costs like interest and taxes are deducted to arrive at net income.
5.2The Balance Sheet
The balance sheet reflects the financial position of a firm as of a particular point in time. It is laid out to clearly
depict and support the accounting equation:A classified balance
sheet breaks down the assets and liabilities sections into current and noncurrent for greater transparency.
5.3The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement
The financial statements are all tied together. The income statement is generated first, as net income is
needed in order to determine the ending balance of retained earnings, a key account in the equity section of
the balance sheet.
5.4The Statement of Owner’s Equity
The statement of owner’s equity is divided by each type of equity the firm has: common stock, preferred stock,
additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, for example. Beginning balances are provided, and all key
transactions impacting equity are provided in order to show how ending balance were derived. Key
transactions commonly include recording net income or loss, issuing additional stock, and paying out
dividends.
5.5The Statement of Cash Flows
Under accrual accounting, transactions are recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. This
creates a timing difference. Net profit, therefore, does not necessarily mean a firm has cash, and a net loss
doesn’t mean they don’t have any cash. To reconcile net income to actual cash flow and see how a firm
generates and uses its funds, a statement of cash flows is prepared. The statement reflects cash flow from
operating activities, financing activities, and investing activities.
5.6Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)
Operating cash flow reflects the cash generated by (or used by) the core business function. Free cash flow to
the firm (FCFF) or simply free cash flow (FCF) is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from operating
cash flow. FCF reflects the cash available to repay debts, pay dividends to shareholders, and contribute to cash
needs for growth.
5.7Common-Size Statements
Common-size statements are a restatement of the financial statements with all dollar figures restated as a
percentage. On the income statement, each line is restated as a percentage of net sales. On the balance sheet,
each line is restated as a percentage of total assets. Common-size statements are useful for analysis and are
particularly helpful in comparing firms of different sizes.
5.8Reporting Financial Activity
Publicly traded firms must file company and financial data with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
on a regular basis. Key reports include the quarterly report, called a 10-Q, and the annual report, called a 10-K.

Why It Matters
Financial analysis is a crucial element of business, but it can be used in personal finance as well. It differs
depending on the role and perspective of those performing the analysis. For example, your personal
accountant will have different goals and needs in making recommendations to you about your personal
finances. All accounting professionals use financial analysis to check for validity, accurate data, compliance in
reporting, and more.
Some tactics for managing your personal finances can be the same as for managing business finances. For
example, reducing expenses and maximizing returns on long-term investments are always good practices.
Debt can also be a beneficial tool in both personal and professional finances when used appropriately. Debt is
neither inherently good nor bad; it simply needs to be properly managed in order to achieve a reasonable
return in exchange for the cost and risk it poses.
Though the process and tools may be similar, financial analysis from a business perspective has different goals
and needs. Investors are looking to identify firm performance, financial health, and profitability. Financial
analysts closely review information found on financial statements so they can make informed business
decisions. The income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows,
among other financial information, are analyzed for internal and external stakeholders and provide a company
with valuable information about its overall performance and specific areas for improvement. The analysis can

help with budgeting and making decisions about where the company could cut costs, how it might increase
revenues, and what capital investment opportunities it should pursue.

Financial Analyst
Lots of individuals and companies perform financial analysis. One of these roles is that of afinancial
analyst. The skills and qualifications of a financial analyst vary widely from one industry to another, but
there are a number of similarities in individuals who hold these roles. As you watch thevideo about
financial analysts(https://openstax.org/r/video-about-financial-analysts), consider your own career path
and how your skills, abilities, and interests may fit this role.
6.1Ratios: Condensing Information into Smaller Pieces
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain the importance of financial statement analysis in making informed decisions about business
opportunities.
•Outline the limitations of financial statement analysis in making investment decisions.
When considering the outcomes from analysis, it is important for a company to understand that the data
generated needs to be compared to similar data within the industry at large as well as that of close
competitors. The company should also consider its past experience and how it corresponds to current and
future performance expectations.
Importance of Ratios and Analysis
Financial ratios help internal and external stakeholders make informed decisions about actions like investing,
becoming a supplier, making a loan, or altering internal operations, among other things. The information
resulting from ratio analysis can be used to examine trends in performance, establish benchmarks for success,
set budget expectations, and compare industry competitors. There are four main types of ratios: liquidity,
solvency, efficiency, and profitability. While outcomes for some ratios may seem more ideal, the industry in
which the business operates can change the influence of these outcomes on stakeholder decisions.
There are several benefits to analyzing financial statements. The information can show trends over time, which
can help in making future business decisions. Converting information to percentages or ratios eliminates
some of the disparities between competitors’ sizes and operating abilities, making it easier for stakeholders to
make informed decisions. It can assist with understanding the makeup of current operations within the
business and which shifts need to occur internally to increase productivity.
Limitation of Financial Statement Analysis
Though useful, it’s important to note that there are limitations to financial statement analysis as well.
Stakeholders need to remember that past performance does not always predict future performance. Economic
influences, such as inflation or a recession, could skew the data being analyzed. Additionally, the way a
company reports information may change over time. For example, there could be changes in where and when
certain transactions are recorded, and this may not be immediately evident to financial statement users. It is
also key to note that though all publicly traded companies in the United States are required to followGenerally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), there are many estimates and flexibility in how some standards are
applied. This means that firms can still follow accounting standards appropriately but present some
information differently from other firms.
It makes good sense for a company to use financial statement analysis to guide future operations so it can

Access for free at openstax.org

budget properly, control costs, increase revenues, and make long-term expenditure decisions. As long as
stakeholders understand the limitations of financial statement analysis, it is a useful way to predict growth and
financial strength.
Despite limitations, ratios are still a valuable tool if used appropriately. The next section discusses several
operating efficiency ratios including accounts receivable turnover, total asset turnover, inventory turnover, and
days’ sales in inventory. Operating efficiency ratios help users see how well management is using the financial
assets of the firm.
6.2Operating Efficiency Ratios
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate accounts receivable turnover to assess a firm’s performance in managing customer receivables.
•Evaluate management’s use of assets using total asset turnover and inventory turnover.
•Assess organizational performance using days’ sales in inventory calculations.
Efficiency ratios show how well a company uses and manages its assets, one key element of financial health.
Important areas of efficiency are the management of sales, accounts receivable, and inventory. A company
that is efficient will usually be able to generate revenues quickly using the assets it has acquired. Let’s examine
fourefficiency ratios: accounts receivable turnover, total asset turnover, inventory turnover, anddays’ sales
in inventory.
Accounts Receivable Turnover
For our discussion of financial statement analysis, we will look atClear Lake Sporting Goods. Clear Lake
Sporting Goods is a small merchandising company (a company that buys finished goods and sells them to
consumers) that sells hunting and fishing gear.Figure 6.2shows the comparative income statements and
balance sheets for the past two years.
Figure6.2Comparative Income Statements and Year-End Balance SheetsNote that the comparative income statements and
6.2 • Operating Efficiency Ratios167

balance sheets have been simplified here and do not fully reflect all possible company accounts.
To begin an analysis of receivables, it’s important to first understand the cycles and periods used in the
calculations.
Operating Cycle
A period is oneoperating cycleof a business. The operating cycle includes the cash conversion cycle plus the
accounts receivable cycle (discussed below). Essentially it is the time it takes a business to purchase or make
inventory and then sell it. For example, assume Clear Lake Sporting Goods orders and receives a shipment of
fishing lures on June 1. It stocks the shelves with lures and tracks its inventory and sales. By July 15, all the
lures from that shipment are gone. In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.
Cash Conversion Cycle
Cash, however, doesn’t necessarily flow linearly with accounting periods or operating cycles. The cash
conversion cycle is the time it takes to spend cash to purchase inventory, produce the product, sell it, and then
collect cash from the customer. Accounts receivable is one section of that cycle. Referring to Clear Lake’s June
1 shipment of lures that sold by July 15, assume that some of the customers were fishing guides that keep an
open account with Clear Lake. This company did not pay for its lures until August 15 when it settled its
account. In this example, Clear Lake’s cash cycle is 75 days.
Let’s take a look at the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which helps assess that element of the cash
conversion cycle.
Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio
Receivables ratios show company performance in relation to current receivables (what is due from customers),
as well as credit policy effect on sales growth. One receivables ratio is called theaccounts receivable
turnover ratio.This ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are collected
during a year and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that receivables are collected quickly.
This quick cash collection may be viewed as a positive occurrence because liquidity improves, and the
company may reinvest in its business sooner when the value of the dollar has more buying power (time value
of money). The higher number of times may also be a negative occurrence, signaling that credit extension
terms are too tight, and it may exclude qualified consumers from purchasing. Excluding these customers
means that they may take their business to a competitor, thus reducing potential sales.
In contrast, a lower number of times indicates that receivables are collected at a slower rate. A slower
collection rate could signal that lending terms are too lenient; management might consider tightening lending
opportunities and more aggressively pursuing payment from its customers. The lower turnover also shows
that the company has cash tied up in receivables longer, thus hindering its ability to reinvest this cash in other
current projects. The lower turnover rate may signal a high level of bad debt accounts. The determination of a
high or low turnover rate really depends on the standards of the company’s industry. It’s key to note the
tradeoff in adjusting credit terms. Loose credit terms may attract more customers but may also increase bad
debt expense. Tighter credit terms may attract fewer customers but may also reduce bad debt expense.
The formula for accounts receivable turnover is
Net credit sales are sales made on credit only; cash sales are not included because they do not produce
receivables. However, many companies do not report credit sales separately from cash sales, so “net sales”
may be substituted for “net credit sales” in this case. Beginning and ending accounts receivable refer to the
1686 • Measures of Financial Health
Access for free at openstax.org

beginning and ending balances in accounts receivable for the period. The beginning accounts receivable
balance is the same figure as the ending accounts receivable balance from the prior period.
When computing the accounts receivable turnover for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, let’s assume net credit sales
make up $100,000 of the $120,000 of the net sales found on the income statement in the current year.
To gain a better understanding of its ratio performance, Clear Lake Sporting Goods can compare its turnover
to industry averages, key competitors, and its own historical ratios. Given this outcome, the managers may
want to consider stricter credit lending practices to make sure credit customers are of a higher quality. They
may also need to be more aggressive with collecting any outstanding accounts.

6.2 • Operating Efficiency Ratios169

Total Asset Turnover
Total asset turnovermeasures the ability of a company to use its assets to generate revenues. A company
would like to use as few assets as possible to generate the most net sales. Therefore, a higher total asset
turnover means the company is using their assets very efficiently to produce net sales. The formula for total
asset turnover is
Average total assets are found by dividing the sum of beginning and ending total assets balances found on the
balance sheet. The beginning total assets balance in the current year is taken from the ending total assets
balance in the prior year.
Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ total asset turnover is
The outcome of 0.53 means that for every $1 of assets, $0.53 of net sales are generated. Over time, Clear Lake
Sporting Goods would like to see this turnover ratio increase.
Inventory Turnover
Inventory turnovermeasures how many times during the year a company has sold and replaced inventory.
This can tell a company how well inventory is managed. A higher ratio is preferable; however, an extremely
high turnover may mean that the company does not have enough inventory available to meet demand. A low
turnover may mean the company has too much supply of inventory on hand. The formula for inventory
turnover is
Cost of goods sold for the current year is found on the income statement. Average inventory is found by
dividing the sum of beginning and ending inventory balances found on the balance sheet. The beginning
inventory balance in the current year is taken from the ending inventory balance in the prior year.
Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ inventory turnover is
A ratio of 1.6 times seems to be a very low turnover rate for Clear Lake Sporting Goods. This may mean the
company is maintaining too high an inventory supply to meet a low demand from customers. Managers may
want to decrease their on-hand inventory to free up more liquid assets to use in other ways. Keep in mind,
ratios should not be taken out of context. One ratio alone can’t tell the whole story. Ratios should be used with
caution and in conjunction with other ratios and additional financial and contextual information.
As with accounts receivable, there is a trade-off to consider in managing inventory. Low turnover will usually
1706 • Measures of Financial Health

mean a low risk of stockouts and the ability to carry more of what customers are looking for. But high
inventory levels will mean that more cash is tied up in inventory. High turnover will mean carrying less
inventory and the higher risk of stockouts, causing customers to go elsewhere to find what they need.

Days’ Sales in Inventory
Days’ sales in inventoryexpresses the number of days it takes a company to turn inventory into sales. The
fewer the number of days, the more quickly the company can sell its inventory. The greater the number of
days, the longer it takes to sell its inventory. The formula for days’ sales in inventory is
Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ days’ sales in inventory is
Depending on the industry, 243 days may be a long time to sell inventory. While industry dictates what is an
acceptable number of days to sell inventory, 243 days is likely to be unsustainable long-term. Remember, it’s
important to not take one ratio out of context. Review the ratio in conjunction with other ratios and other
financial data. For example, we might review the days’ sales in inventory along with accounts receivable
turnover for Clear Lake Sporting Goods relative to the industry average to get a better picture of Clear Lake’s
performance in this area.

6.3Liquidity Ratios
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate current, quick, and cash ratios to assess a firm’s liquidity and make informed business decisions.
•Assess organizational performance using liquidity ratios.
Liquidityrefers to the business’s ability to manage current assets or convert assets into cash in order to meet
short-term cash needs, another aspect of a firm’s financial health. Examples of the most liquid assets include
cash, accounts receivable, and inventory for merchandising or manufacturing businesses. The reason these
are among the most liquid assets is that these assets will be turned into cash more quickly than land or
buildings, for example. Accounts receivable represents goods or services that have already been sold and will
typically be paid/collected within 30 to 45 days.
Inventory is less liquid than accounts receivable because the product must first be sold before it generates
cash (either through a cash sale or sale on account). Inventory is, however, more liquid than land or buildings
because, under most circumstances, it is easier and quicker for a business to find someone to purchase its
goods than it is to find a buyer for land or buildings.
Current Ratio
Thecurrent ratiois closely related to working capital; it represents the current assets divided by current
liabilities. The current ratio utilizes the same amounts as working capital (current assets and current liabilities)
but presents the amount in ratio, rather than dollar, form. That is, the current ratio is defined as current
assets/current liabilities. The interpretation of the current ratio is similar to working capital. A ratio of greater
than one indicates that the firm has the ability to meet short-term obligations with a buffer, while a ratio of
less than one indicates that the firm should pay close attention to the composition of its current assets as well
as the timing of the current liabilities.
The current ratio in the current year for Clear Lake Sporting Goods is
A 2:1 ratio means the company has twice as many current assets as current liabilities; typically, this would be
plenty to cover obligations. A 2:1 ratio is actually quite high for most companies and most industries. Again,
it’s recommended that ratios be used in conjunction with one another. An analyst would likely look at the high
current ratio and low accounts receivable turnover to begin asking questions about management
performance, as this might indicate a trouble area (high inventory and slow collections).

Quick Ratio
Thequick ratio, also known as theacid-test ratio, is similar to the current ratio except current assets are more
narrowly defined as the most liquid assets, which exclude inventory and prepaid expenses. The conversion of

assets. A company will want to know what it has on hand and can use quickly if an immediate obligation is
due. The formula for the quick ratio is
The quick ratio for Clear Lake Sporting Goods in the current year is
A 1.6:1 ratio means the company has enough quick assets to cover current liabilities. It’s again key to note that
a single ratio shouldn’t be used out of context. A 1.6 ratio is difficult to interpret on its own. Industry averages
and trend analysis for Clear Lake Sporting Goods would also be helpful in giving the ratio more meaning.

mean for Target?
Cash Ratio
Cash is the most liquid asset a company has, andcash ratiois often used by investors and lenders to asses an
organization’s liquidity. It represents the firm’s cash and cash equivalents divided by current liabilities and is a
more conservative look at a firm’s liquidity than the current or quick ratios. The ratio is reflected as a number,
not a percentage. A cash ratio of 1.0 means the firm has enough cash to cover all current liabilities if
something happened and it was required to pay all current debts immediately. A ratio of less than 1.0 means
the firm has more current liabilities than it has cash on hand. A ratio of more than 1.0 means it has enough
cash on hand to pay all current liabilities and still have cash left over. While a ratio greater than 1.0 may sound
ideal, it’s important to consider the specifics of the company. Sitting on idle cash is not ideal, as the cash could
be used to earn a return. And having a ratio less than 1.0 isn’t always bad, as many firms operate quite
successfully with a ratio of less than 1.0. Comparing the company ratio with trend analysis and with industry
averages will help provide more insight.
The cash ratio for Clear Lake Sporting Goods in the current year is:
A 1.1 ratio means the company has enough cash to cover current liabilities.

6.4Solvency Ratios
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Evaluate organizational solvency using the debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity ratios.
•Calculate the times interest earned ratio to assess a firm’s ability to cover interest expense on debt as it
comes due.
Solvencyimplies that a company can meet its long-term obligations and will likely stay in business in the
future. Meeting long-term obligations includes the ability to pay any interest incurred on long-term debt. Two
main solvency ratios are the debt-to-equity ratio and the times interest earned ratio.
Debt-to-Assets Ratio
Thedebt-to-assets ratioshows the relationship between debt and assets. It reflects how much of the assets
of the business was financed through debt. It reflects the company’s leverage and is helpful to analysts in
comparing how leveraged one company is compared to another.
Debts normally carry interest expense and must be repaid. The debt-to-assets ratio includes all debt—both
long-term debt and current liabilities. The formula for the debt-to-assets ratio is
The information needed to compute the debt-to-assets ratio for Clear Lake Sporting Goods in the current year

This means that 60 percent of Clear Lake’s assets are financed by debt. We can also then infer that the other
40 percent is financed by equity. A ratio higher than 1.0 means the company has more debts than assets,
which means it has negative equity. In Clear Lake’s case, a 60 percent debt-to-assets ratio indicates some risk,
but perhaps not a high risk. Comparing Clear Lake’s ratio to industry averages would provide better insight.

Debt-to-Equity Ratio
Thedebt-to-equity ratioshows the relationship between debt and equity as it relates to business financing. A
company can take out loans, issue stock, and retain earnings to be used in future periods to keep operations
running. A key difference in debt and equity is the interest expense repayment that a loan carries as opposed
to equity, which does not have this requirement. Therefore, a company wants to know how much debt and
equity contribute to its financing. The formula for the debt-to-equity ratio is
The information needed to compute the debt-to-equity ratio for Clear Lake Sporting Goods in the current year
can be found on the balance sheet.
This means that for every one dollar of equity contributed toward financing, $1.50 is contributed from lenders.
Recall that total assets equal total liabilities plus total equity. Both the debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity ratio
have total liabilities in the numerator. The difference in the two ratios is the denominator. The denominator for
the debt-to-equity ratio is total stockholder equity. The denominator for the debt-to-assets ratio is total assets,
or total liabilities plus total equity. Thus, the two ratios contain the same information, making calculating both
ratios redundant. A financial analyst may prefer to calculate one ratio over the other because of the format of
readily available industry data to use for comparison purposes or for consistency with other calculations the
analyst is performing.

Earnings per Share (EPS)
Earnings per share (EPS)measures the portion of a corporation’s profit allocated to each outstanding share

be a key indicator of the value of a company’s stock.
It’s key to note, however, that EPS, like any ratio, should be used with caution and in tandem with other ratios
and contextual data. Many financial professionals choose not to rely on income statement data and, similarly,
EPS because they feel the cash flow statement provides more reliable and insightful information.

Calculating Earnings per Share
Earnings per share is the profit a company earns for each of its outstanding common shares. Both the balance
sheet and income statement are needed to calculate earnings per share. The balance sheet provides details on
the preferred dividend rate, the total par value of the preferred stock, and the number of common shares
outstanding. The income statement indicates the net income for the period. The formula to calculate basic
earnings per share is
By removing the preferred dividends from net income, the numerator represents the profit available to
common shareholders. Because preferred dividends represent the amount of net income to be distributed to
preferred shareholders, this portion of the income is obviously not available for common shareholders. While
a number of variations of measuring a company’s profit, such asNOPAT (net operating profit after taxes)and
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), are used in the financial world, GAAP
requires companies to calculate earnings per share based on a corporation’s net income, as this amount
appears directly on a company’s income statement, which for public companies must be audited.
In the denominator, only common shares are used to determine earnings per share because earnings per
share is a measure of earnings for each common share of stock. The denominator can fluctuate throughout
the year as a company issues and buys back shares of its own stock. The weighted average number of shares
is used on the denominator because of this fluctuation. To illustrate, assume that a corporation began the year
with 600 shares of common stock outstanding and then on April 1 issued 1,000 more shares. During the period
January 1 to March 31, the company had the original 600 shares outstanding. Once the new shares were
issued, the company had the original 600 plus the new 1,000 shares, for a total of 1,600 shares for each of the
next nine months—from April 1 to December 31. To determine the weighted average shares, apply these
fractional weights to both of the stock amounts (seeFigure 6.6).
6.5 • Market Value Ratios177

Figure6.6Weighted Shares
If the shares were not weighted, the calculation would not consider the time period during which the shares
were outstanding.
To illustrate how earnings per share is calculated, assume Clear Lake Sporting Goods earns $35,000 in net
income during the current year. During the year, the company also declared a $5,000 dividend on preferred
stock and a $6,000 dividend on common stock. The company had 8,000 common shares outstanding the entire
year. Clear Lake Sporting Goods has generated $3.75 of earnings ($35,000 less the $5,000 of preferred
dividends) for each of the 8,000 common shares of stock it has outstanding.
Measuring Performance with Earnings per Share
Earnings per share is a key profitability measure that both current and potential common stockholders
monitor. Its importance is accentuated by the fact that GAAP requires public companies to report earnings per
share on the face of a company’s income statement. This is the only ratio that requires such prominent
reporting. If fact, public companies are required to report two different earnings per share amounts on their
income statements—basic and diluted. We’ve illustrated the calculation of basic earnings per share. Diluted
earnings per share, which is not demonstrated here, involves the consideration of all securities, such as stocks
and bonds, that could potentially dilute, or reduce, the basic earnings per share.

As you review data, keep in mind that a company can manipulate or impact its earnings per share by
issuing new shares or buying back issued shares. What are the ethical implications of earnings per share
calculations?
Common stock shares are normally purchased by investors to generate income through dividends or to sell at
a profit in the future. Investors realize that inadequate earnings per share can result in poor or inconsistent
dividend payments and fluctuating stock prices. As such, companies seek to produce earnings per share
amounts that rise each period. However, an increase in earnings per share may not always reflect favorable
performance, as there are multiple reasons that earnings per share may increase. One way earnings per share
can increase is through increased net income. On the other hand, it can also increase when a company buys
back its own shares of stock.
For example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods generated net income of $30,000 and paid out $3,000 in

preferred shareholder dividends last year. In addition, 10,550 shares of common stock were outstanding
throughout the entire year. In January of the current year, the company buys back shares of its common stock
and holds them as treasury shares, making its current weighted average shares outstanding for this year
8,000. Net income for the current year is $35,000, $5,000 of which was paid to preferred shareholders in
dividends. In the prior year, the company’s earnings per share was
Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ current year earnings per share is
The purchase of treasury stock in the current year reduces the common shares outstanding to 8,000 because
treasury shares are considered issued but not outstanding. Earnings per share for the current year is now
$3.75 per share even though earnings only increased by $5,000. It’s key to note the impact of purchasing
treasury stock and the intentions in doing so. Treasury stock is commonly purchased for a variety of reasons,
but doing so to intentionally manipulate earnings per should not be a primary reason.
This increase in earnings per share occurred because the net income is now spread over fewer shares of stock.
Similarly, earnings per share can decline even when a company’s net income increases if the number of shares
increases at a higher degree than net income.

negative $1.27. In other words, Amazon lost $1.27 for each share of common stock outstanding. Would you
have invested?
Solution:
Answers will vary. A strong response would include the idea that a negative or small earnings per share
reflects upon the historical operations of a company. Earnings per share does not predict the future.
Investors in 1997 looked beyond Amazon’s profitability and saw its business model having strong future
potential.

Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio
Theprice/earnings (P/E) ratiomeasures the current market share price of a company’s stock relative to its
earnings per share (EPS). The ratio is helpful in comparing performance and stock price of a company to other
companies. It’s also helpful in evaluating how much investors are willing to pay for earnings performance.
Investors, in particular, use this ratio and rely on two key characteristics: past performance (trailing) and
future estimates (forward). Trailing data can be calculated but is also easily found online, as it’s a common
measure reported on financial sites. Investors will often look forP/E TTM, which is the price/earnings ratio for
the trailing 12 months (last year worth of earnings data). This helps investors assess one day’s stock price
relative to the earnings per share over the past 12 months. P/E ratio is widely used by investors to determine if
a stock is over- or undervalued. It also helps them compare one firm to that of the industry average or index,
such as theS&P 500.
In the prior section we saw earnings per share data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods. Using its current year
earnings per share of $3.75 and the current stock price of $69.41, we can calculate price/earnings ratio for
Clear Lake Sporting Goods:
An 18.51 ratio means an investor would expect to invest $18.51 to gain $1 of earnings.
Book Value per Share
Book value per shareis often used hand in hand with market value per share. Investors compare the two in
order to see if the stock is possibly over- or undervalued. Book value is derived from accounting practices and
shows the value of the firm on paper. Market value, on the other hand, is determined by supply and demand,
based on what investors are willing to pay for the stock. If the market value per share is higher than the book
value, the stock is considered overvalued. If the market value is lower than the book value, it’s considered
undervalued.
In theory, book value per share represents the total value common shareholders would receive if the firm
were liquidated. It is total equity less preferred equity, spread across the total shares outstanding. The formula
to calculate book value per share is
The book value per share for Clear Lake Sporting Goods is
If investors compared the book value per share of $10.00 for Clear Lake Sporting Goods to the P/E ratio of
$18.51, they would likely conclude that the stock was undervalued in the year of analysis.

6.6Profitability Ratios and the DuPont Method
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate profit margin to determine how much sales revenues the firm has translated into income.
•Evaluate firm performance by calculating return on total assets and return on equity.
•Analyze organizational performance using DuPont method calculations.
Profitability considers how well a company produces returns given its operational performance. The company
needs to use its assets and operations efficiently to increase profit. To assist with profit goal attainment,
company revenues need to outweigh expenses. Let’s consider three profitability measurements and ratios:
profit margin, return on total assets, and return on equity.
Profit Margin
Profit marginrepresents how much of sales revenue has translated into income. This ratio shows how much
of each $1 of sales is returned as profit. The larger the ratio figure (the closer it gets to 1), the more of each
sales dollar is returned as profit. The portion of the sales dollar not returned as profit goes toward expenses.
The formula for profit margin is
For Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the profit margin in the current year is
This means that for every dollar of sales, $0.29 returns as profit. If Clear Lake Sporting Goods thinks this is too
low, the company would try to find ways to reduce expenses and increase sales.
Return on Total Assets
Thereturn on total assetsmeasures the company’s ability to use its assets successfully to generate a profit.
The higher the return (ratio outcome), the more profit is created from asset use. Average total assets are
found by dividing the sum of beginning and ending total assets balances found on the balance sheet. The
beginning total assets balance in the current year is taken from the ending total assets balance in the prior
year. The formula for return on total assets is
For Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the return on total assets for the current year is
The higher the figure, the better the company is using its assets to create a profit. Industry standards can
dictate what an acceptable return is.

Return on Assets
Thisvideo explains how to calculate return on assets(https://openstax.org/r/video-explains-how-to-
calculate)and how to interpret the results. The video provides the formula, a discussion of the concept, and
the importance of the ratio.
Return on Equity
Return on equitymeasures the company’s ability to use its invested capital to generate income. The invested
capital comes from stockholders’ investments in the company’s stock and its retained earnings and is
leveraged to create profit. The higher the return, the better the company is doing at using its investments to
yield a profit. The formula for return on equity is
Average stockholders’ equity is found by dividing the sum of beginning and ending stockholders’ equity
balances found on the balance sheet. The beginning stockholders’ equity balance in the current year is taken
from the ending stockholders’ equity balance in the prior year. Keep in mind that the net income is calculated
after preferred dividends have been paid.
For Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we will use the net income figure and deduct the preferred dividends that have
been paid. The return on equity for the current year is
The higher the figure, the better the company is using its investments to create a profit. Industry standards
can dictate what an acceptable return is.
The DuPont Method
ROE in its basic form is useful; however, there are really three components of ROE: operating efficiency (profit
margin), asset usage (total asset turnover), and leverage (equity ratio). This is known as theDuPont method.
It originated in 1919 when the DuPont company implemented it for internal measurement purposes.

The
DuPont method can be expressed using this formula:
Profit margin indicates how much profit is generated by each dollar of sales and is computed as shown:
Total asset turnover indicates the number of sales dollars produced by every dollar invested in capital
assets—in other words, how efficiently the company is using its capital assets to generate sales. It is computed
as shown:

The equity multiplier measures leverage. It is computed as shown:
Using DuPont analysis, investors can see overall performance broken down into smaller pieces, which helps
them better understand what is driving ROE. We already have the computations for Clear Lake Sporting
Goods’ profit margin and total asset turnover:
We can calculate the equity multiplier using the equity multiplier equation and prior calculations for Clear
Lake’s average total assets and average stockholder equity:

The DuPont Method
Thisvideo about the DuPont method(https://openstax.org/r/video-about-DuPont-method)walks through
its history, discusses its basic components, and shows how to calculate and interpret each measurement.
Performance Analysis
ROE captures the nuances of all three elements. A good sales margin and a proper asset turnover are both
needed for a successful operation. Like all ratios, assessing performance is relative. It’s important to look at
the ratio in context of the organization, its history, and the industry. If we compare Clear Lake’s ROE of 26.4%
to the recreational products industry average of 12.56% for the same year, it would appear as though Clear
Lake Sporting Goods is outperforming the general industry. However, recreational products can include a wide
variety of businesses beyond just the outdoor gear in which Clear Lake Sporting Goods specializes. An analyst
could look at other key competitors such asCabela’sorBass Pro Shopsto get even more relevant
comparisons.
Clear Lake Sporting Goods is also technically a retail store, albeit a specialized one. An analyst might also
consider the industry averages for general or online retail of 20.64% and 27.05%, respectively. Compared to
the broader retail industry, Clear Lake Sporting Goods is still performing well, but its performance is not as

Summary
6.1Ratios: Condensing Information into Smaller Pieces
Ratios used in financial analysis can help investors and other analysts identify trends over time, compare
companies to one another, and make informed decisions about a company. There are, however, limitations to
analysis, so it should be used wisely and in conjunction with other contextual information available.
6.2Operating Efficiency Ratios
Efficiency ratios measure how well management uses the assets of the organization to earn a profit. Common
efficiency ratios include accounts receivable turnover, total asset turnover, inventory turnover, and days’ sales
in inventory.
6.3Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity ratios help analysts measure how well an organization can meet its short-term obligations (liabilities)
as they come due. Common ratios to measure liquidity include the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the cash
ratio. Each of these three ratios includes more (cash ratio) or less liquid (current ratio) current assets in its
measure of liquidity.
6.4Solvency Ratios
Solvency ratios measure how well an organization can meet its long-term obligations (liabilities) as they come
due, or in more general terms, its ability to stay in business. Common solvency ratios include the debt-to-
assets ratio and the debt-to-equity ratio.
6.5Market Value Ratios
Market value ratios help analysts assess the value of publicly traded firms in the market. The most commonly
used market value ratios include earnings per share (EPS), the price/earnings ratio, and book value per share.
6.6Profitability Ratios and the DuPont Method
Profitability ratios help measure how effectively the organization earns a profit. Common profitability ratios
include profit margin, return on total assets, and return on equity. The DuPont method breaks down return on
equity into three smaller components for a more thorough assessment of performance: profit margin, total
asset turnover, and an equity multiplier.

Chapter Outline
7.1Now versus Later Concepts
7.2Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics
7.3Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems
7.4Applications of TVM in Finance
Why It Matters
One of the single most important concepts in the study of finance is the time value of money (TVM). This
concept puts forward the idea that a dollar received today is worth more than, and therefore preferable to, a
dollar received at some point in the future. The three primary reasons for this are that (1) money received now
can be saved or invested now and earn interest or a return, resulting in more money in the future; (2) any
promise of future payments of cash will always carry the risk of default; and (3) it is simple human nature for
people to prefer making their purchases of goods and services in the present rather than waiting to make
them at some future time.
For this reason, it is important to incentivize people to give up their present consumption patterns by offering
them greater value in the future. Based on the concept of TVM, it can be said that a dollar was worth more to
us, and thus carried more value, yesterday than it is to us today. It also then follows that a dollar in our
possession right now carries a greater value for us than a dollar we might receive tomorrow or at some other
point in the future.
The entire concept of the time value of money is particularly important because it allows savers and investors
to make better-informed decisions about what to do with their money. TVM can help a person understand
which option may be best based on the critical factors of overall risk, rates of interest, inflation, and return.
TVM can also be used to help a person understand how much money they’ll need to save in an interest-
bearing account in order to reach a desired financial goal, such as saving $50,000 in 10 years in an account that
earns 4% compound interest each year. TVM is the key underlying principle of such important financial
analytical activities as retirement planning, corporate capital project evaluation, and even deciding on your

own personal investments and bank accounts.
If the main concept behind the TVM is that a specific amount of money in hand now is worth more today than
that same amount of money will be worth tomorrow, you might think that a person would be better off
spending their money now rather than saving it for later use. However, we know that this is not always the
case. Sometimes it is simply a better idea to save your money. While inflation can have the effect of making a
dollar worth less tomorrow than it is worth today, the positive effect of compound interest works in favor of
savers and investors.
7.1Now versus Later Concepts
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain why time has an impact on the value of money.
•Explain the concepts of future value and present value.
•Explain why lump sum cash flow is the basis for all other cash flows.
How and Why the Passage of Time Affects the Value of Money
The concept of thetime value of money (TVM)is predicated on the fact that it is possible to earninterest
income on cash that you decide to deposit in aninvestmentor interest-bearing account. As times goes by,
interest is earned on amounts you have invested (present value), which effectively means that time will add
value (future value) to your savings. The longer the period of time you have your money invested, the more
interest income will accrue. Also, the higher the rate of interest your account or investment is earning, again,
the more your money will grow.
Understanding how to calculate values of money in the present and at different points in the future is a key
component of understanding the material presented in this chapter—and of making important personal
financial decisions in your future (seeFigure 7.2).
Figure7.2The Time Value of MoneyIt is better to be paid today, or you will lose out on the money you would have earned in
interest.
The Lump Sum Payment or Receipt
The most basic type of financial transaction involves a simple, one-time amount of cash, which can be either a
receipt (inflow) or a payment (outflow). Such a one-time transaction is typically referred to as a lump sum. A
lump sum consists of a one-off cash flow that occurs at any single point in time, present or future. Because it is
always possible to dissect more complex transactions into smaller parts, the lump sum cash flow is the basis
on which all other types of cash flow are treated. According to the general principle of adding value, every type
of cash flow stream can be divided into a series of lump sums. For this reason, it is critical to understand the
math associated with lump sums if you wish to have a greater appreciation, and a complete understanding, of
more complicated forms of cash flow that may be associated with an investment or a capital purchase by a

7.2Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Definefuture valueand provide examples.
•Explain how future dollar amounts are calculated using a single-period scenario.
•Describe the impact of compounding.
Because we can invest our money in interest-bearing accounts and investments, its value can grow over time
as interest income accrues or returns are realized on our investments. This concept is referred to asfuture
value (FV). In short, future value refers to how a specific amount of money today can have greater value
tomorrow.
Single-Period Scenario
Let us start with the following example. Your friend is considering putting money in a bank account that will
pay 4% interest per year and is particularly interested in knowing how much money they will have one year
from now if they deposit $1,000 in this account. Your friend understands that you are studying finance and
turns to you for help. By using the TVM principle of future value (FV), you can tell your friend that the answer is
$1,040. The additional $40 that will be in the account after one year will be due to interest earned over that
time. You can calculate this amount relatively easily by taking the original deposit (also referred to as the
principal) of $1,000 and multiplying it by the annual interest rate of 4% for one period (in this case, one year).
By taking the interest earned amount of $40 and adding it to the original principal of $1,000, you will arrive at a
total value of $1,040 in the bank account at the end of the year. So, the $1,040 one year from today is equal to
$1,000 today when working with a 4% earning rate. Therefore, based on the concept of TVM, we can say that
$1,040 represents the future value of $1,000 one year from today and at a 4% rate of interest. We will discuss
interest rates and their importance in TVM decisions in more detail later in this chapter; for now, we can
consider interest rate as a percentage of the principal amount that is earned by the original lender of funds
and/or charged to the borrower of these same funds. Following are a few more examples of the single-period
scenario.
If a person deposits $300 in an account that pays 5% per year, at the end of one year, they will have
If a company has earnings of $2.50 per share and experiences a 10% increase in the following year, the
earnings per share in year two are
If a retail store decides on a 3% price increase for the following year on an item that is currently selling for $50,
the new price in the following year will be
The Impact of Compounding
What would happen if your friend were willing to wait one more year to receive their lump sum payment?
What would the future dollar value in their account be after a two-year period? Returning to our earlier
example, assume that during the second year, your friend leaves the principal ($1,000) and the earned interest
($40) in the account, thereby reinvesting the entire account balance for another year. The quoted interest rate
of 4% reflects the interest the account would earn each year, not over the entire two-year savings period. So,
during the second year of savings, the $1,000 deposit and the $40 interest earned during the first year would
7.2 • Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics193

both earn 4%:
The additional $1.60 is interest on the first year’s interest and reflects the compounding of interest.Compound
interestis the term we use to refer to interest income earned in subsequent periods that is based on interest
income earned in prior periods. To put it simply, compound interest refers to interest that is earned on
interest. Here, it refers to the $1.60 of interest earned in the second year on the $40.00 of interest earned in
the first year. Therefore, at the end of two years, the account would have a total value of $1,081.60. This
consists of the original principal of $1,000 plus the $40.00 interest income earned in year one and the $41.60
interest income earned in year two.
The amount of money your friend would have in the account at the end of two years, $1,081.60, is referred to
as the future value of the original $1,000 amount deposited today in an account that will earn 4% interest every
year.
Simple interest applies to year 1 while compound interest or “interest on interest” applies to year 2. This is
calculated using the following method:
So, the total amount that would be in the account after two years, at 4% annual interest, would be
.
To determine any future value of money in an interest-bearing account, we multiply the principal amount by 1
plus the interest rate for each year the money remains in the account. From this, we can develop the future
value formula:
In this formula, the number of times we multiply bydepends entirely on the number of years the
money will remain in the bank account, earning interest, before it is withdrawn in a final lump sum distribution
paid out from the account at the end of the chosen savings period. The 1 in the formula represents the
principal amount, or the original $1,000 deposit, which will be included in the final total lump sum payment
when the account is closed and all money is withdrawn at the end of the predetermined savings period.
We can write the above equation in a more condensed mathematical form using time value of money
notation, as follows:
Using these inputs, we have the following formula:
With this equation, we can calculate the value of the savings account after any number of years. For example,
suppose we are considering 3, 10, and 50 years from the original deposit date at the annual 4% interest rate:
How can this savings account have grown to be so large after 50 years? This question is answered by the
impact of compounding interest. Every year, the interest earned in previous years will also earn interest along

with the initial deposit. This will have the effect of accelerating the growth of the total dollar value of the
account.
This is the important effect of the compounding of interest: money grows in larger and larger increments the
longer you leave it in an interest-bearing account. In effect, the compounding of interest over time accelerates
the growth of money.
In order to determine the FV of any amount of money, it will always be necessary to know the following pieces
of information: (1) the principal, initial deposit, orpresent value (PV); (2) the rate of interest, usually
expressed on an annual basis asr; and (3) the number of time periods that the money will remain in the
account (n). The interest rate is often referred to as thegrowth rate, or the annual percentage increase on
savings or on an investment. When the rate is raised to the power of the number of periods, the formula
will yield a number that is commonly referred to as the future value interest factor (FVIF). As a result
of this process, asn(time, or the number of periods) increases, the future value interest factor will increase.
Also, asr(interest rate) increases, the FVIF will increases. For these reasons, the future value calculation is
directly determined by both the interest rate being used and the total amount of time—specifically, the
number of periods—being considered.
THINK IT THROUGH
Calculating Future Values
Here’s another example of calculating future values in multiple-period scenarios.
On a recent drive, you spotted your dream home, which is currently listed at $400,000. Unfortunately, you
are not in a position to buy it right away and will have to wait at least another six years before you can
afford it. If house values are appreciating at an annual rate of inflation of 4%, how much will a similar house
cost after six years?
Solution:
In this case, PV is the current cost of the house, or $400,000;nis six years;ris the average annual inflation
rate, or 4%; and we have to solve for FV.
Therefore, under these circumstances, the house will cost $506,127.60 after six years.
How Time Impacts Compounding
We have just seen that time will lead to the growth of our money. As long as the prevailing growth or interest
rate of any account we have our money in is positive, the passage of time will have the effect of growing the
value of our money. The longer the period of time, the greater the growth and the larger the future value of
the money will be. This can be reinforced very clearly with the following example.
Melvin is saving money in an account at a local bank that earns 5% per year. He begins with a deposit in his
account of $100 and decides to save his money for exactly one year. He will not be making any further deposits
into the account during the year. Melvin will earnor $5, in interest income. Adding this to the
original deposit balance of $100 will give him a total ofor $105, in the account at the end of one
year.
Melvin likes this idea and believes he may be able to keep his money in the account for a longer period of time.
How much money will he have in his account, without any further deposits, at the end of years two, three, four,
and five?
7.2 • Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics195

Using the future value formula, the calculation is as follows:
How the Interest Rate Impacts Compounding
Melvin likes the idea of earning more money over time, but he also believes that what he would earn in
interest may not be enough for some of the things he plans to buy in the future. His friend suggests finding an
account or some form of investment with a greater interest rate than the 5% he can get at his local bank.
Melvin thinks he can leave his money in an account or investment for a total of five years. He found
investments that will provide annual returns of 6%, 7%, 10%, and 12%. Using the
formula, we can complete the following calculations for him:
Again, Melvin likes this information, and he states that he will try to find the highest interest rate available. This
makes sense, but it’s important to remember that investments are usually not guaranteed to earn you specific
interest rates, or rates of return. Most investments, other thanTreasury investmentssuch as Treasury bonds,
carry some form offinancial risk, either small or large, and the greater the rate of return, the more likely it is
that the risk associated with the investment will also be greater. This risk does not have any effect on the
future calculations we have just completed, but it an important factor to bear in mind and consider well before
moving ahead and putting your money in any investment orfinancial instrument.
7.3Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain how future dollar amounts are calculated.
•Explain how present dollar amounts are calculated.
•Describe how discount rates are calculated.
•Describe how growth rates are calculated.
•Illustrate how periods of time for specified growth are calculated.
•Use a financial calculator and Excel to solve TVM problems.
We can determine future value by using any of four methods: (1) mathematical equations, (2) calculators with
financial functions, (3) spreadsheets, and (4) FVIF tables. With the advent and wide acceptance and use of
financial calculators and spreadsheet software, FVIF (and other such time value of money tables and factors)
have become obsolete, and we will not discuss them in this text. Nevertheless, they are often still published in
other finance textbooks and are also available on the internet to use if you so choose.
Using Timelines to Organize TVM Information
A useful tool for conceptualizing present value and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual,
1967 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value
Access for free at openstax.org

linear representation of periods and cash flows over a set amount of time. Each timeline shows today at the
left and a desired ending, or future point (maturity date), at the right.
Now, let us take an example of a future value problem that has a time frame of five years. Before we begin to
solve for any answers, it would be a good approach to lay out a timeline like that shown inTable 7.1:
Year
0
(Today)
12345
Table7.1
The timeline provides a visual reference for us and puts the problem into perspective.
Now, let’s say that we are interested in knowing what today’s balance of $100 in our saving account, earning
5% annually, will be worth at the end of each of the next five years. Using the future value formula
that we covered earlier, we would arrive at the following values: $105 at the end of year one, $110.25 at the
end of year two, $115.76 at the end of year three, $121.55 at the end of year four, and $127.63 at the end of
year five.
With the numerical information, the timeline (at a 5% interest or growth rate) would look likeTable 7.2:
Year012345
$100.00$105.00$110.25$115.76$121.55$127.63
Table7.2
Using timelines to lay out TVM problems becomes more and more valuable as problems become more
complex. You should get into the habit of using a timeline to set up these problems prior to using the
equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet to help minimize input errors. Now we will move on to the different
methods available that will help you solve specific TVM problems. These are the financial calculator and the
Excel spreadsheet.
Using a Financial Calculator to Solve TVM Problems
An extremely popular method of solving TVM problems is through the use of a financial calculator. Financial
calculators such as theTexas Instruments BAII Plus™ Professional(https://openstax.org/r/baii-plus-
professional)will typically have five keys that represent the critical variables used in most common TVM
problems:NN,I/YI/Y,PVPV,FVFV, andPMTPMT. These represent the following:
These are the only keys on a financial calculator that are necessary to solve TVM problems involving asingle
payment or lump sum.
Example 1: Future Value of a Single Payment or Lump Sum
Let’s start with a simple example that will provide you with most of the skills needed to perform TVM functions
involving a single lump sum payment with a financial calculator.
7.3 • Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems197

Suppose that you have $1,000 and that you deposit this in a savings account earning 3% annually for a period
of four years. You will naturally be interested in knowing how much money you will have in your account at the
end of this four-year time period (assuming you make no other deposits and withdraw no cash).
To answer this question, you will need to work with factors of $1,000, the present value (PVPV); four periods or
years, represented byNN; and the 3% interest rate, orI/YI/Y. Make sure that the calculator register information is
cleared, or you may end up with numbers from previous uses that will interfere with the solution. The register-
clearing process will depend on what type of calculator you are using, but for the TI BA II Plus™ Professional
calculator, clearing can be accomplished by pressing the keys2ND2NDandFVFV[CLR TVM].
Once you have cleared any old data, you can enter the values in the appropriate key areas: 4 forNN, 3 forI/YI/Y,
and 1000 forPVPV. Now you have entered enough information to calculate the future value. Continue by
pressing theCPTCPT(compute) key, followed by theFVFVkey. The answer you end up with should be displayed as
1,125.51 (seeTable 7.3).

Important Notes for Using a Calculator and the Cash Flow Sign Convention
Please note that the PV was entered as negative $1,000 (or -$1000). This is because most financial calculators
(and spreadsheets) follow something called the cash flow sign convention, which is a way for calculators and
spreadsheets to keep the relative direction of the cash flow straight. Positive numbers are used to represent
cash inflows, and negative numbers should always be used for cash outflows.
In this example, the $1,000 is an investment that requires a cash outflow. For this reason, -1000 is entered as
the present value, as you will be essentially handing this $1,000 to a bank or to someone else to initiate the
transaction. Conversely, the future value represents a cash inflow in four years’ time. This is why the calculator
generates a positive 1,125.51 as the end result of this calculation.
Had you entered the present value of $1,000 as a positive number, there would have been no real concern, but
the ending future value answer would have been returned expressed as a negative number. This would be
correct had you borrowed $1,000 today (cash inflow) and agreed to repay $1,125.51 (cash outflow) four years
from now. Also, it is important that you do not change the sign of any input value by using the--(minus) key).
For example, on the TI BA II Plus™ Professional, you must use the+|-+|-key instead of the minus key. If you
enter 1000 and then hit the+|-+|-key, you will get a negative 1,000 amount showing in the calculator display.
An important feature of most financial calculators is that it is possible to change any of the variables in a
problem without needing to reenter all of the other data. For example, suppose that we wanted to find out the
future value in our bank account if we left the money from our previous example invested for 20 years instead
1The specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II Plus™ Professional model, but you can use other
financial calculators for these types of calculations.

of 4. Before clearing any of the data, simply enter 20 forNNand then press theCPTCPTkey and then theFVFVkey.
After this is done, all other inputs will remain the same, and you will arrive at an answer of $1,806.11.

How to Determine Future Value When Other Variables Are Known
Here’s an example of using a financial calculator to solve a common time value of money problem. You
have $2,000 invested in a money market account that is expected to earn 4% annually. What will be the total
value in the account after five years?
Solution:
Follow the recommended financial calculator steps inTable 7.4.

Table7.4Calculator Steps for Determining Future Value
The result of this future value calculation of the invested money is $2,433.31.
Example 2: Present Value of Lump Sums
Solving for the present value (discounted value) of a lump sum is the exact opposite of solving for a future
value. Once again, if we enter a negative value for the FV, then the calculated PV will be a positive amount.
Taking the reverse of what we did in our example of future value above, we can enter -1,125.51 forFVFV, 3 for
I/YI/Y, and 4 forNN. Hit theCPTCPTandPVPVkeys in succession, and you should arrive at a displayed answer of 1,000.
An important constant within the time value of money framework is that the present value will always be less
than the future value unless the interest rate is negative. It is important to keep this in mind because it can
help you spot incorrect answers that may arise from errors with your input.

How to Determine Present Value When Other Variables Are Known
Here is another example of using a financial calculator to solve a common time value of money problem.
You have just won a second-prize lottery jackpot that will pay a single total lump sum of $50,000 five years
from now. How much value would this have in today’s dollars, assuming a 5% interest rate?

Follow the recommended financial calculator steps inTable 7.5.

The present value of the lottery jackpot is $39,176.31.
Example 3: Calculating the Number of Periods
There will be times when you will know both the value of the money you have now and how much money you
will need to have at some unknown point in the future. If you also know the interest rate your money will be
earning for the foreseeable future, then you can solve for N, or the exact amount of time periods that it will
take for the present value of your money to grow into the future value that you will require for your eventual
use.
Now, suppose that you have $100 today and you would like to know how long it will take for you to be able to
purchase a product that costs $133.82.
After making sure your calculator is clear, you will enter 5 forI/YI/Y, -100 forPVPV, and 133.82 forFVFV. Now press
CPTCPTNN, and you will see that it will take 5.97 years for your money to grow to the desired amount of $133.82.
Again, an important thing to note when using a financial calculator to solve TVM problems is that you must
enter your numbers according to the cash flow sign convention discussed above. If you do not make either the
PVPVor theFVFVa negative number (with the other being a positive number), then you will end up getting an error
message on the screen instead of the answer to the problem. The reason for this is that if both numbers you
enter for thePVPVandFVFVare positive, the calculator will operate under the assumption that you are receiving a
financial benefit without making any cash outlay as an initial investment. If you get such an error message in
your calculations, you can simply press theCE/CCE/Ckey. This will clear the error, and you can reenter your data
correctly by changing the sign of eitherPVPVorFVFV(but not both of these, of course).

Determining Periods of Time
Here is an additional example of using a financial calculator to solve a common time value of money
problem. You want to be able to contribute $25,000 to your child’s first year of college tuition and related
expenses. You currently have $15,000 in a tuition savings account that is earning 6% interest every year.
How long will it take for this account grow into the targeted amount of $25,000, assuming no additional
deposits or withdrawals will be made?
Solution:

The result of this calculation is a time period of 8.7667 years for the account to reach the targeted amount.
Example 4: Solving for the Interest Rate
Solving for an interest rate is a common TVM problem that can be easily addressed with a financial calculator.
Let’s return to our earlier example, but in this case, we know that we have $1,000 at the present time and that
we will need to have a total of $1,125.51 four years from now. Let’s also say that the only way we can add to
the current value of our savings is through interest income. We will not be able to make any further deposits in
addition to our initial $1,000 account balance.
What interest rate should we be sure to get on our savings account in order to have a total savings account
value of $1,125.51 four years from now?
Once again, clear the calculator, and then enter 4 forNN, -1,000 forPVPV, and 1,125.51 forFVFV. Then, press theCPTCPT
andI/YI/Ykeys and you will find that you need to earn an average 3% interest per year in order to grow your
savings balance to the desired amount of $1,125.51. Again, if you end up with an error message, you probably
failed to follow the sign convention relating to cash inflow and outflow that we discussed earlier. To correct
this, you will need to clear the calculator and reenter the information correctly.
After you believe you are done and have arrived at a final answer, always make sure you give it a quick review.
You can ask yourself questions such as “Does this make any sense?” “How does this compare to other
answers I have arrived at?” or “Is this logical based on everything I know about the scenario?” Knowing how
to go about such a review will require you to understand the concepts you are attempting to apply and what
you are trying to make the calculator do. Further, it is critical to understand the relationships among the
different inputs and variables of the problem. If you do not fully understand these relationships, you may end
up with an incorrect answer. In the end, it is important to realize that any calculator is simply a tool. It will only
do what you direct it to do and has no idea what your objective is or what it is that you really wish to
accomplish.

Determining Interest or Growth Rate
Here is another example of using a financial calculator to solve a common time value of money problem.
Let’s use a similar example to the one we used when calculating periods of time to determine an interest or
growth rate. You still want to help your child with their first year of college tuition and related expenses.
You also still have a starting amount of $15,000, but you have not yet decided on a savings plan to use.
7.3 • Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems201

Instead, the information you now have is that your child is just under 10 years old and will begin college at
age 18. For simplicity’s sake, let’s say that you have eight and a half years before you will need to meet your
total savings target of $25,000. What rate of interest will you need to grow your saved money from $15,000
to $25,000 in this time period, again with no other deposits or withdrawals?

Using Excel to Solve TVM Problems
Excel spreadsheets can be excellent tools to use when solving time value of money problems. There are
dozens of financial functions available in Excel, but a student who can use a few of these functions can solve
almost any TVM problem. Special functions that relate to TVM calculations are as follows:
Excel also includes a function called Payment (PMT) that is used in calculations involving multiple payments or
deposits (annuities). These will be covered inTime Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments.
Future Value (FV)
The Future Value function in Excel is also referred to as FV and can be used to calculate the value of a single
lump sum amount carried to any point in the future. The FV function syntax is similar to that of the other four
basic time-value functions and has the following inputs (referred to as arguments), similar to the functions
listed above:
Lump sum problems do not involve payments, so the value of Pmt in such calculations is 0. Another argument,
Future Value (FV)
Present Value (PV)
Number of Periods (NPER)
Interest Rate (RATE)
Rate: Interest Rate
Nper: Number of Periods
Pmt: Payment
PV: Present Value
2027 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value

Type, refers to the timing of a payment and carries a default value of the end of the period, which is the most
common timing (as opposed to the beginning of a period). This may be ignored in our current example, which
means the default value of the end of the period will be used.
The spreadsheet inFigure 7.3shows two examples of using the FV function in Excel to calculate the future
value of $100 in five years at 5% interest.
In cell E1, the FV function references the values in cells B1 through B4 for each of the arguments. When a user
begins to type a function into a spreadsheet, Excel provides helpful information in the form of on-screen tips
showing the argument inputs that are required to complete the function. In our spreadsheet example, as the
FV formula is being typed into cell E2, a banner showing the arguments necessary to complete the function
appears directly below, hovering over cell E3.
Figure7.3Using the FV Function inExcel
Cells E1 and E2 show how the FV function appears in the spreadsheet as it is typed in with the required
arguments. Cell E4 shows the calculated answer for cell E1 after hitting the enter key. Once the enter key is
pressed, the hint banner hovering over cell E3 will disappear. The second example of the FV function in our
example spreadsheet is in cell E6. Here, the actual numerical values are used in the FV function equation
rather than cell references. The method in cell E8 is referred to ashard coding. In general, it is preferable to
use the cell reference method, as this allows for copying formulas and provides the user with increased
flexibility in accounting for changes to input data. This ability to accept cell references in formulas is one of the
greatest strengths of Excel as a spreadsheet tool.

Determining Future Value When Other Variables Are Known. You have $2,000 invested in a money market
account that is expected to earn 4% annually. What will be the total value in the account in five years?
Note: Be sure to follow the sign conventions. In this case, the PV should be entered as a negative value.
Note: In Excel, interest and growth rates must be entered as percentages, not as whole integers. So, 4 percent
must be entered as 4% or 0.04—not 4, as you would enter in a financial calculator.
Note: It is always assumed that if not specifically stated, the compounding period of any given interest rate is
annual, or based on years.
Note: The Excel command used to calculate future value is as follows:
7.3 • Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems203

=FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type])
You may simply type the values for the arguments in the above formula. Another option is to use the Excel
insert function option. If you decide on this second method, below are several screenshots of dialog boxes you
will encounter and will be required to complete.
1.First, go to Formulas in the upper menu bar, and select the Insert Function option. When you do so, a
dialog box will appear that looks like what you see inFigure 7.4.
Figure7.4Dialog Box to Insert FV Function
This dialog box allows you to either search for a function or select a function that has been used recently.
In this example, you can search for FV by typing this in the search box and selecting Go, or you can simply
choose FV from the list of most recently used functions (as shown here with the highlighted FV option).

Note that cell addresses are used in this example. This allows the spreadsheet to still be useful if you
decide to change any of the variables. You may also type values directly into the Function Arguments
dialog box, but if you do this and you have to change any of your inputs later, you will have to reenter the
new information. Using cell addresses is always a preferable method of entering the function argument
data.

Additional notes:
1.The Pmt argument or variable can be ignored in this instance, or you can enter a placeholder value of
7.3 • Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems205

zero. This example shows a blank or ignored entry, but either option may be used in problems such as this
where the information is not relevant.
2.The Type argument does not apply to this problem. Type refers to the timing of cash flows and is usually
used in multiple payment or annuity problems to indicate whether payments or deposits are made at the
beginning of periods or at the end. In single lump sum problems, this is not relevant information, and the
Type argument box is left empty.
3.When you use cell addresses as function argument inputs, the numerical values within the cells are
displayed off to the right. This helps you ensure that you are identifying the correct cells in your function.
The final answer generated by the function is also displayed for your preliminary review.
Once you are satisfied with the result, hit the OK button, and the dialog box will disappear, with only the final
numerical result appearing in the cell where you have set up the function.
The FV of this present value has been calculated as approximately $2,433.31.
Present Value (PV)
We have covered the idea that present value is the opposite of future value. As an example, in the spreadsheet
shown inFigure 7.3, we calculated that the future value of $100 five years from now at a 5% interest rate would
be $127.63. By reversing this process, we can safely state that $127.63 received five years from now with a 5%
interest (or discount) rate would have a value of just $100 today. Thus, $100 is its present value. In Excel, the
PV function is used to determine present value (seeFigure 7.7).
Figure7.7Using the PV Function in Excel
The formula in cell E1 uses cell references in a similar fashion to our FV example spreadsheet above. Also
similar to our earlier example is the hard-coded formula for this calculation, which is shown in cell E6. In both
cases, the answers we arrive at using the PV function are identical, but once again, using cell references is
preferred over hard coding if possible.

Determining Present Value When Other Variables Are Known
You have just won a second-prize lottery jackpot that will pay a single total lump sum of $50,000 five years
from now. You are interested in knowing how much value this would have in today’s dollars, assuming a 5%
interest rate.

Notes:
1.If you wish for the present value amount to be positive, the future value you enter here should be a
negative value.
2.In Excel, interest and growth rates must be entered as percentages, not as whole integers. So, 5
percent must be entered as 5% or 0.05—not 5, as you would enter in a financial calculator.
3.It is always assumed that if not specifically stated, the compounding period of any given interest rate is
annual, or based on years.
4.The Excel command used to calculate present value is as shown here:
=PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])
Solution:
As with the FV formula covered in the first tab of this workbook, you may simply type the values for the
arguments in the above formula. Another option is to again use the Insert Function option in Excel.Figure
7.8,Figure 7.9, andFigure 7.10provide several screenshots that demonstrate the steps you’ll need to follow
if you decide to enter the PV function from the Insert Function menu.
1.First, go to Formulas in the upper menu bar, and select Insert Function. When you do so, the Insert
Function dialog box will appear (seeFigure 7.8).
Figure7.8Dialog Box to Insert PV Function
As discussed in the FV function example above, this dialog box allows you to either search for a
function or select a function that has been used recently. In this example, you can search for PV by
typing this into the search box and selecting Go, or you can simply choose PV from the list of the most
recently used functions.
2.Once you have highlighted PV, click the OK button, and a new dialog box will appear for you to enter
the necessary details. Similar to our FV function example, it will look likeFigure 7.9.

Figure7.9New Dialog Box for PV Function Arguments
Figure 7.10shows the completed data input for the function arguments. Note that once again, cell
addresses are used in this example. This allows the spreadsheet to still be useful if you decide to
change any of the variables. As in the FV function example, you may also type values directly in the
Function Arguments dialog box, but if you do this and you have to change any of your input later, you
will have to reenter the new information. Remember that using cell addresses is always a preferable
method of entering the function argument data.
Figure7.10Completed Dialog Box for PV Function Arguments
Again, similar to our FV function example, the Function Arguments dialog box shows values off to the

right of the data entry area, including our final answer. The Pmt and Type boxes are again not relevant
to this single lump sum example, for reasons we covered in the FV example.
Review your answer. Once you are satisfied with the result, click the OK button, and the dialog box will
disappear, with only the final numerical result appearing in the cell where you have set up the function.
The PV of this future value has been calculated as approximately $39,176.31.
Periods of Time
The following discussion will show you how to use Excel to determine the amount of time a given present
value will need to grow into a specified future value when the interest or growth rate is known.
You want to be able to contribute $25,000 to your child’s first year of college tuition and related expenses. You
currently have $15,000 in a tuition savings account that is earning 6% interest every year. How long will it take
for this account grow into the targeted amount of $25,000, assuming no additional deposits or withdrawals are
made?
Notes:
1.As with our other examples, interest and growth rates must be entered as percentages, not as whole
integers. So, 6 percent must be entered as 6% or 0.06—not 6, as you would enter in a financial calculator.
2.The present value needs to be entered as a negative value in accordance with the sign convention covered
earlier.
3.The Excel command used to calculate the amount of time, or number of periods, is this:
=NPER (rate, pmt, pv, [fv], [type])
As with our FV and PV examples, you may simply type the values of the arguments in the above formula, or we
can again use the Insert Function option in Excel. If you do so, you will need to work with the various dialog
boxes after you select Insert Function.
1.First, go to Formulas in the upper menu bar, and select the Insert Function option. When you do so, the
Insert Function dialog box will appear (seeFigure 7.11).

Figure7.11Dialog Box to Insert NPER Function
As discussed in our previous examples on FV and PV, this menu allows you to either search for a function
or select a function that has been used recently. In this example, you can search for NPER by typing this
into the search box and selecting Go, or you can simply choose NPER from the list of most recently used
functions.
2.Once you have highlighted NPER, click the OK button, and a new dialog box will appear for you to enter
the necessary details. As in our previous examples, it will look likeFigure 7.12.

addresses in this example.
Figure7.13Completed Dialog Box for NPER Function Arguments
As in the previous function examples, values are shown off to the right of the data input area, and our final
answer of approximately 8.77 is displayed at the bottom. Also, once again, the Pmt and Type boxes are not
relevant to this single lump sum example.
Review your answer, and once you are satisfied with the result, click the OK button. The dialog box will
disappear, with only the final numerical result appearing in the cell where you have set up the function.
The amount of time required for the desired growth to occur is calculated as approximately 8.77 years.
Interest or Growth Rate
You can also use Excel to determine the required growth rate when the present value, future value, and total
number of required periods are known.
Let’s discuss a similar example to the one we used to calculate periods of time. You still want to help your child
with their first year of college tuition and related expenses, and you still have a starting amount of $15,000, but
you have not yet decided which savings plan to use.
Instead, the information you now have is that your child is just under 10 years old and will begin college at age
18. For simplicity’s sake, let’s say that you have eight and a half years until you will need to meet your total
savings target of $25,000. What rate of interest will you need to grow your saved money from $15,000 to
$25,000 in this time, again with no other deposits or withdrawals?
Note: The present value needs to be entered as a negative value.
Interest Rate (RATE)
7.3 • Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems211

Note: The Excel command used to calculate interest or growth rate is as follows:
=RATE(nper, pmt, pv, [fv], [type], [guess])
As with our other TVM function examples, you may simply type the values for the arguments into the above
formula. We also again have the same alternative to use the Insert Function option in Excel. If you choose this
option, you will again see the Insert Function dialog box after you click the Insert Function button.
1.First, go to Formulas in the upper menu bar, and select the Insert Function option. When you do so, the
Insert Function dialog box will appear (seeFigure 7.14).
Figure7.14Dialog Box to Insert RATE Function
2.This time, find and highlight RATE, and click the OK button once you have done so. The Function
Arguments dialog box will look likeFigure 7.15.

Figure7.15New Dialog Box for RATE Function Arguments
Once we complete the input, again using cell addresses for the required argument values, we will see
what is shown inFigure 7.16.
Figure7.16Completed Dialog Box for RATE Function Arguments
As in our other examples, cell values are shown as numerical values off to the right, and our answer of
approximately 0.0619, or 6.19%, is shown at the bottom of the dialog box.
This answer also can be checked from a logic point of view because of the similar example we worked
through when calculating periods of time. Our present value and future value are the same as in that
example, and our time period is now 8.5 years, which is just under the result we arrived at (8.77 years) in
7.3 • Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems213

the periods example.
So, if we are now working with a slightly shorter time frame for the savings to grow from $15,000 into
$25,000, then we would expect to have a slightly greater growth rate. That is exactly how the answer turns
out, as the calculated required interest rate of approximately 6.19% is just slightly greater than the growth
rate of 6% used in the previous example. So, based on this, it looks like our answer here passes a simple
“sanity check” review.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain how the time value of money can impact your personal financial goals.
•Explain how the time value of money is related to inflation.
•Explain how the time value of money is related to financial risk.
•Explain how compounding period frequency affects the time value of money.
Single-Period Scenario
Let’s say you want to buy a new car next year, and the one you have your eye on should be selling for $20,000
a year from now. How much will you need to put away today at 5% interest to have $20,000 a year from now?
Essentially, you are trying to determine how much $20,000 one year from now is worth today at 5% interest
over the year. To find a present value, we reverse the growth concept and lower ordiscountthe future value
back to the current period.
The interest rate that we use to determine the present value of a future cash flow is referred to as the
discount ratebecause it is bringing the money back in time in terms of its value. The discount rate refers to
the annual rate of reduction on a future value and is the inverse of the growth rate. Once we know this
discount rate, we can solve for the present value (PV), the value today of tomorrow’s cash flow. By changing
the FV equation, we can turn
into
which is the present value equation. The fraction shown above is referred to as the present value interest
factor (PVIF). The PVIF is simply the reciprocal of the FVIF, which makes sense because these factors are doing
exactly opposite things. Therefore, the amount you need to deposit today to earn $20,000 in one year
at 5% interest is
The Multiple-Period Scenario
There will often be situations when you need to determine the present value of a cash flow that is scheduled to
occur several years in the future (seeFigure 7.17). We can again use the formula for present value to calculate
a value today of future cash flows over multiple time periods.

Figure7.17Determining Future Cash Flow
An example of this would be if you wanted to buy a savings bond for Charlotte, the daughter of a close friend.
The face value of the savings bond you have in mind is $1,000, which is the amount Charlotte would receive in
30 years (the future value). If the government is currently paying 5% per year on savings bonds, how much will
it cost you today to buy this savings bond?
The $1,000 face value of the bond is the future value, and the number of yearsnthat Charlotte must wait to
get this face value is 30 years. The interest rateris 5.0% and is the discount rate for the savings bond. Applying
the present value equation, we calculate the current price of this savings bond as follows:
So, it would cost you $231.38 to purchase this 30-year, 5%, $1,000 face-valued bond.
What we have done in the above example is reduce, or discount, the future value of the bond to arrive at a
value expressed in today’s dollars. Effectively, this discounting process is the exact opposite of compounding
interest that we covered earlier in our discussion of future value.
An important concept to remember is thatcompoundingis the process that takes a present valuation of
money to some point in the future, whilediscountingtakes a future value of money and equates it to present
dollar value terms.
Common applications in which you might use the present value formula include determining how much
money you would need to invest in an interest-bearing account today in order to finance a college education
for your oldest child and how much you would need to invest today to meet your retirement plans 30 years
from now.
TVM, Inflation, Compounding Interest, Investing, Opportunity Costs, and Risk
The time value of money (TVM) is a critical concept in understanding the value of money relative to the
amount of time it is held, saved, or invested. The TVM concept and its specific applications are frequently used
by individuals and organizations that might wish to better understand the values of financial assets and to
improve investing and saving strategies, whether these are personal or within business environments.
As we have discussed, the key element behind the concept of TVM is that a given amount of money is worth
more today than that same amount of money will be at any point in the future. Again, this is because money
can be saved or invested in interest-bearing accounts or investments that will generate interest income over
time, thus resulting in increased savings and dollar values as time passes.
Inflation
The entire concept of TVM exists largely due to the presence ofinflation. Inflation is defined as a general
increase in the prices of goods and services and/or a drop in the value of money and its purchasing power.
The purchasing power of the consumer dollar is a statistic tracked by the part of the US Bureau of Labor
7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance215

Statistics and is part of the consumer price index (CPI) data that is periodically published by that government
agency. In a way, purchasing power can be viewed as a mirror image or exact opposite of inflation or increases
in consumer prices, as measured by the CPI.Figure 7.18demonstrates the decline in the purchasing power of
the consumer dollar over the 13-year period from 2007 to 2020.
With this in mind, we can work with the TVM formula and use it to help determine the present value of money
you have in hand today, as well as how this same amount of money may be valued at any specific point in the
future and at any specific rate of interest.
Figure7.18Historical Purchasing Power Decline as a Result of Inflation, 2007–2020(data source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)
The Relationship between TVM and Inflation
As we have seen, the future value formula can be very helpful in calculating the value of a sum of cash (or any
liquid asset) at some future point in time. One of the important ideas relating to the concept of TVM is that it
is preferable to spend money today instead of at some point in the future (all other things being equal) when
inflation is positive. However, in very rare instances in our economy when inflation is negative, spending
money later is preferable to spending it now. This is because in cases of negative inflation, the purchasing
power of a dollar is actually greater in the future, as the costs of goods and services are declining as we move
into the future.
Most investors would be inclined to take a payment of money today rather than wait five years to receive a
payment in the same amount. This is because inflation is almost always positive, which means that general
prices of goods and services tend to increase over the passage of time. This is a direct function and result of
normal economic growth. The crux of the concept of TVM is directly related to maintaining the present value
of financial assets or increasing the value of these financial assets at different points in the future when they
may be needed to obtain goods and services. If a consumer’s monetary assets grow at a greater rate than
inflation over any period of time, then the consumer will realize an increase in their overall purchasing power.
Conversely, if inflation exceeds savings or investment growth, then the consumer will lose purchasing power
as time goes by under such conditions.
The Impact of Inflation on TVM
The difference between present and future values of money can be easily seen when considered under the
effects of inflation. As we discussed above, inflation is defined as a state of continuously rising prices for goods
and services within an economy. In the study of economics, the laws of supply and demand state that
increasing the amount of money within an economy without increasing the amount of goods and services
available will give consumers and businesses more money to spend on those goods and services. When more
money is created and made available to the consuming public, the value of each unit of currency will diminish.
2167 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value
Access for free at openstax.org

This will then have the effect of incentivizing consumers to spend their money now, or in the very near future,
instead of saving cash for later use. Another concept in economics states that this relationship between
money supplyand monetary value is one of the primary reasons why theFederal Reservemight at times
take steps to inject money into a stagnant, lethargic economy. Increasing the money supply will lead to
increased economic activity and consumer spending, but it can also have the negative effect of increasing the
costs of goods and services, furthering an increase in the rate of inflation.
Consumers who decide to save their money now and for the foreseeable future, as opposed to spending it
now, are simply making the economic choice to have their cash on hand and available. So, this ends up being a
decision that is made despite the risk of potential inflation and perhaps losing purchasing power. When
inflationary risk is low, most people will save their money to have it available to spend later. Conversely, in
times when inflationary risk is high, people are more likely to spend their money now, before its purchasing
power erodes. This idea of inflationary risk is the primary reason why savers and investors who decide to save
now in order to have their money available at some point in the future will insist they are paid, through
interest or return on investment, for the future value of any savings or financial instrument.
Lower interest rates will usually lead to higher inflation. This is because, in a way, interest rates can be viewed
as the cost of money. This allows for the idea that interest rates can be further viewed as a tax on holding on
to sums of money instead of using it. If an economy is experiencing lower interest rates, this will make money
less expensive to hold, thus incentivizing consumers to spend their money more frequently on the goods and
services they may require. We have also seen that the more quickly inflation rates rise, the more quickly the
general purchasing power of money will be eroded. Rational investors who set money aside for the future will
demand higher interest rates to compensate them for such periods of inflation. However, investors who save
for future consumption but leave their moneyuninvestedorunderinvestedin low-interest-bearing accounts
will essentially lose value from their financial assets because each of their future dollars will be worth less,
carrying less purchasing power when they end up needing it for use. This relationship of saving and planning
for the future is one of the most important reasons to understand the concept of the time value of money.
Nominal versus Real Interest Rates
One of the main problems of allowing inflation to determine interest rates is that current interest rates are
actually nominal interest rates. Nominal rates are “stated,” not adjusted for the effects of inflation. In order to
determine more practicalreal interest rates, the original nominal rate must be adjusted using an inflation
rate, such as those that are calculated and published by theBureau of Labor Statisticswithin theconsumer
price index (CPI).
A concept referred to as theFisher effect, named for economist Irving Fisher, describes the relationship
between inflation and the nominal and real interest rates and is expressed using the following formula:
whereiis the nominal interest rate,Ris the real interest rate, andhis the expected inflation rate.
An example of the Fisher effect would be seen in the case of a bond investor who is expecting a real interest
rate of return of 6% on the bond, in an economy that is experiencing an expected inflation rate of 2%. Using
the above formula, we have
So, the nominal interest rate on the bond amounts to 8.12%, with a real interest rate of 6% within an economy
that is experiencing a 2% inflation rate. This is a logical result because in a scenario of positive inflation, a real
rate of return would always be expected to amount to less than the stated or nominal rate.
7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance217

Interest and Savings
Savings are adversely affected by negative real interest rates. A person who holds money in the form of cash is
actually losing future purchasing value when real interest rates are negative. A saver who decides to hold
$1,000 in the form of cash for one year at a negative real interest rate of −3.65% per year will lose
or $36.50, in purchasing power by the end of that year.
Ordinarily, interest rates would rise to compensate for negative real rates, but this might not happen if the
Federal Reserve takes steps to maintain low interest rates to help stimulate and stabilize the economy. When
interest rates are at such low levels, investors are forced out of Treasury andmoney market investmentsdue
to their extremely poor returns.
It soon becomes obvious that the time value of money is a critical concept because of its tremendous and
direct impact on the daily spending, saving, and investment decisions of the people in our society. It is
therefore extremely important that we understand how TVM and government fiscal policy can affect our
savings, investments, purchasing behavior, and our overall personal financial health.
Compounding Interest
As we discussed earlier, compound interest can be defined as interest that is being earned on interest. In
cases ofcompounding interest, the amount of money that is being accrued on previous amounts of earned
interest income will continue to grow with eachcompounding period. So, for example, if you have $1,000 in a
savings account and it is earning interest at a 10% annual rate and is compounded every year for a period of
five years, the compounding will allow for growth after one year to an amount of $1,100. This comprises the
original principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the
total amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.
So, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in
interest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.
Now, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this
scenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves
you in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the
time value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal
saving and investing.
It is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples
we have already covered. In some cases, interest can be compounded quarterly, monthly, daily, or even
continuously. The general rule to apply is that the more frequent the compounding period, the greater the
future value of a savings amount, a bond, or any other financial instrument. This is, of course, assuming that
all other variables are constant.
The math for this remains the same, but it is important that you be careful with your treatment and usage of
rate (r) and number of periods (n) in your calculations.
For example, $1,000 invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be worth
. But that same $1,000 invested for that same period of time—one year—and
earning interest at the same annual rate but compounded monthly would grow to
, because the interest paid each month is earning interest on interest at a 6%
rate. Note that we representras the interest paid per periodandnas the number
of periods (12 months in a year;) rather than the number of years, which is only one.
Continuing with our example, that same $1,000 in an account with interest compounded quarterly, or four
times a year, would grow toin one year. Note that this final amount ends up
being greater than the annually compounded future value of $1,060.00 and slightly less than the monthly
2187 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value
Access for free at openstax.org

compounded future value of $1.061.67, which would appear to make logical sense.
The total differences in future values among annual, monthly, and quarterly compounding in these examples
are insignificant, amounting to less than $1.70 in total. However, when working with larger amounts, higher
interest rates, more frequent compounding periods, and longer terms, compounding periods and frequency
become far more important and can generate some exceptionally large differences in future values.
Ten million dollars at 12% growth for one year and compounded annually amounts to
, while 10 million dollars on the same terms but compounded quarterly will
produce. Most wealthy and rational investors and savers would be
very pleased to earn that additional $55,088.10 by simply having their funds in an account that features
quarterly compounding.
In another example, $200 at 60% interest, compounded annually for six years, becomes
, while this same amount compounded quarterly grows to
.
An amount of $1 at 3%, compounded annually for 100 years, will be worth. The same
dollar at the same interest rate, compounded monthly over the course of a century, will grow to
.
This would all seem to make sense due to the fact that in situations when compounding increases in
frequency, interest income is being received during the year as opposed to at the end of the year and thus
grows more rapidly to become a larger and more valuable sum of money. This is important because we know
through the concept of TVM that having money now is more useful to us than having that same amount of
money at some later point in time.
The Rule of 72
The rule of 72 is a simple and often very useful mathematical shortcut that can help you estimate the impact of
any interest or growth rate and can be used in situations ranging from financial calculations to projections of
population growth. The formula for the rule of 72 is expressed as the unknown (the required amount of time
to double a value) calculated by taking the number 72 and dividing it by the known interest rate or growth
rate. When using this formula, it is important to note that the rate should be expressed as a whole integer, not
as a percentage. So, as a result, we have
This formula can be extremely practical when working with financial estimates or projections and for
understanding how compound interest can have a dramatic effect on an original amount or monetary
balance.
Following are just a few examples of how the rule of 72 can help you solve problems very quickly and very
easily, often enabling you to solve them “in your head,” without the need for a calculator or spreadsheet.
Let’s say you are interested in knowing how long it will take your savings account balance to double. If your
account earns an interest rate of 9%, your money will takeor 8, years to double. However, if you are
earning only 6% on this same investment, your money will take, or 12, years to double.
Now let’s say you have a specific future purchasing need and you know that you will need to double your
money in five years. In this case, you would be required to invest it at an interest rate of, or 14.4%.
Through these sample examples, it is easy to see how relatively small changes in a growth or interest rate can
have significant impact on the time required for a balance to double in size.
To further illustrate some uses of the rule of 72, let’s say we have a scenario in which we know that a country’s
gross domestic productis growing at 4% a year. By using the rule of 72 formula, we can determine that it will
7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance219

take the economy 72/4, or 18, years to effectively double.
Now, if the economic growth slips to 2%, the economy will double in, or 36, years. However, if the rate of
growth increases to 11%, the economy will effectively double in, or 6.55, years. By performing such
calculations, it becomes obvious that reducing the time it takes to grow an economy, or increasing its rate of
growth, could end up being very important to a population, given its current level of technological innovation
and development.
It is also very easy to use the rule of 72 to express future costs being impacted by inflation or future savings
amounts that are earning interest.
To apply another example, if the inflation rate in an economy were to increase from 2% to 3%, consumers
would lose half of the purchasing power of their money. This is calculated as the value of their money doubling
in, or 24, years as compared to, or 36, years—quite a substantial difference.
Now, let’s say that tuition costs at a certain college are increasing at a rate of 7% per year, which happens to
be greater than current inflation rates. In this case, tuition costs would end up doubling in, or about 10.3,
years.
In an example related to personal finance, we can say that if you happen to have an annual percentage rate of
24% interest on your credit card and you do not make any payments to reduce your balance, the total amount
you owe to the credit card company will double in only, or 3, years.
So, as we have seen, the rule of 72 can clearly demonstrate how a relatively small difference of 1 percentage
point in GDP growth or inflation rates can have significant effects on any short- or long-term economic
forecasting models.
It is important to understand that the rule of 72 can be applied in any scenario where we have a quantity or an
amount that is in the process of growing or is expected to grow for any period of time into the future. A good
nonfinancial use of the rule of 72 might be to apply it to some population projections. For example, an increase
in a country’s population growth rate from 2% to 3% could present a serious problem for the planning of
facilities and infrastructure in that country. Instead of needing to double overall economic capacity inor
36, years, capacity would have to be expanded in only, or 24, years. It is easy to see how dramatic an
effect this would be when we consider that the entire schedule for growth or infrastructure would be reduced
by 12 years due to a simple and relatively small 1% increase in population growth.
Investing and Risk
Investing is usually a sound financial strategy if you have the money to do so. When investing, however, there
are certain risks you should always consider first when applying the concepts of the time value of money. For
example, making the decision to take $1,000 and invest it in your favorite company, even if it is expected to
provide a 5% return each year, is not a guarantee that you will earn that return—or any return at all, for that
matter. Instead, as with any investment, you will be accepting the risk of losing some or even all of your money
in exchange for the opportunity to beat inflation and increase your future overall wealth. Essentially, it is risk
and return that are responsible for the entire idea of the time value of money.
Risk and return are the factors that will cause a rational person to believe that a dollar risked should end up
earning more than that single dollar.
To summarize, the concept of the time value of money and the related TVM formulas are extremely important
because they can be used in different circumstances to help investors and savers understand the value of their
money today relative to its earning potential in the future. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that
inflation has on your money and why saving your money early can help increase the value of your savings
dollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects of inflation.

Opportunity Costs
The concept ofopportunity costarises from the idea that there will always be possible options that are
sacrificed with every option we decide on or for every choice that we make. For example, let’s consider the
decision to go to college after you graduate from high school. This decision, as with just about any other, will
involve evaluating opportunity costs. If you choose to go to college, this will result in your sacrificing four years
of potential earnings that you could have had if you had decided to take a job instead of attending school.
Also, in addition to the lost salary, you would be losing out on four years of work experience that could have
had a positive impact on your résumé or your future earnings prospects.
Of course, the entire idea behind furthering one’s education is that you are hopeful that by choosing to go to
college, you will increase the likelihood of earning a greater salary over the course of your lifetime than you
would have if you had chosen to join the workforce directly out of high school. So, this ends up being a bit of a
risk, but one that you have considered. The idea is that you are hoping for a more significant payoff down the
road than if you had made the decision not to continue with your studies. When it comes to opportunity costs
and the time value of money, it is obvious that there will always be costs associated with every forgone
financial opportunity we pass on when we make a different choice. The logical individual can only hope that
these choices produce a better end result than if we had made different choices and pursued any of our
forgone alternatives. This also applies in situations where we may sit idly by and decide to take no action at all.
For example, if you are putting $1,000 in a savings account to save for a house, you may be giving up an
opportunity to grow that money in an investment account that would earn a greater rate of return. In another
example, being able to calculate the future value of your money will tell you that instead of investing, you
probably should be paying down your 24% APR credit card debt that is costing you hundreds of dollars a
month—hundreds of dollars more than you might earn from an investment account.

Summary
7.1Now versus Later Concepts
This section discussed the underlying concepts of the time value of money (TVM). Because it is possible to earn
interest income on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or an interest-bearing account, money
that you have now or receive sooner will be more valuable to you than the same amount of money received
later.
7.2Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics
Future value refers to the value that a current amount will eventually grow into at a given interest rate over a
specific period of time. The single-period scenario is one way in which future amounts are calculated.
Compounding, which is interest earned on interest, also affects the future value of money.
7.3Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems
Calculations can be used to determine future and present dollar amounts, discount and growth rates, and
periods of time required for specific growth. Time value of money problems can be solved using mathematical
equations, calculators with financial functions, and spreadsheets. A useful tool for conceptualizing present
value and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual, linear representation of the timing of
periods and cash flows over a set amount of time.
7.4Applications of TVM in Finance
The idea of the time value of money is often considered to be the cornerstone concept of the study of finance.
TVM can help investors and savers understand the value of money today relative to its earning potential in the
future. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that inflation has on money and why saving your money
early can help increase the value of your savings dollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects
of inflation. Of course, it is important to remember that there will always be possible options that are sacrificed
with every option you decide on and every choice you make.

Why It Matters
Although this text is directed at business finance students, our daily decisions as consumers are largely based
on money and finance to just as great an extent. An old adage in finance claims, “If you aren’t in control of
your money, your money is controlling you.” Fortunately, learning to manage your money is not difficult if
you’re disciplined and understand some simple techniques. For example, several years ago, the author was
negotiating for a three-year auto loan from a well-known regional dealer, who was offering an interest rate of
2%. When the manager left the room for a few minutes, we pulled out a financial calculator and proved in less
than a minute that the actual interest rate in the payments he was proposing was nearly double the quoted
and advertised rate.
In addition to understanding how the loan process works, which improves your negotiation skills when
borrowing, businesses and individuals can better control their investments by understanding basic rules of
finance, particularly as seen in this and the preceding chapter. Assume you pledge to invest $1,000 per year at
5% return per year and are curious about how much you will have accumulated by age 60. If you begin at age
30, you will have $69,760; if you begin at age 20, you will have $126,840. Can the extra 10 years make that much
of a difference? We’ll see that indeed they can, and the calculations required to prove it can take less than two
minutes.

popular bookThe Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America’s Wealthy, authors ThomasStanley

and WilliamDankoillustrate these terms with a flowing river. A river is in constant movement, and as the flow
or depth increases, this is comparable to one’s income increasing through the promotions, salary increases,
and bonuses one receives. Unfortunately, many individuals then increase their spending habits in response,
justifying a better car, a second home, or more lavish vacations. Wealth, in contrast, is comparable to taking a
bucket of water from the river and holding it aside in a tank for oneself. Financial professionals often call this
“paying yourself first.” Stanley and Danko list this among the “secrets” referenced in the title of their book.
8.1Perpetuities
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define perpetuity.
•Explain how perpetuities are valued.
InTime Value of Money I, we learned that the value of money changes with the passage of time. Decision-
makers consider how investments, projects, and even opportunity costs gain value as we move forward into
the future. They similarly consider how value in the future can be reduced to a value in present or past
periods. We saw that these value projections are called determination of future value (compounding, moving
forward on a timeline) or present value (discounting, moving backward on a timeline). The easiest way to
visualize this movement through time, whether forward or backward, is by use of a timeline.
Throughout the first chapter on the time value of money, we were analyzing a single amount. In this chapter,
we deal with a stream of payments made periodically—in other words, payments made or received regularly
over a span of time. We begin with the illustration of a perpetuity.
What Is a Perpetuity?
Aperpetuityis a series of payments or receipts that continues forever, or perpetually. One of the best ways to
analyze the basics of anannuity(the stream of payments to be paid or received in the future) is by starting
with a perpetuity. The most common examples of perpetuities in the author’s experience are college chair
endowments and preferred stock.
If you gift $1,500,000 to a college to name a professor’s chair for your family, you might specify that the money
must be held in perpetuity and invested by the college to yield a fixed 3%. The college will take those proceeds
of the investment, leaving your original $1,500,000 intact, and use the annual interest of $45,000 to fund a
portion of the professor’s salary.
Another common example ispreferred stock. Most preferred stock issues carry a fixed and predetermined
rate of dividend. If we assume that the dividend will not change in future years, then preferred dividend
shareholders will receive a fixed amount of money in future years—assuming, of course, that the company’s
board of directors declares the dividends sufficient to fund these requirements. If we assume that the dividend
is declared and paid and that it remains constant, this represents a perpetuity.
For example, Shaw Inc. has issued 100,000 shares of preferred stock with a stated value of $50 and a 4%
dividend. Therefore, if they can fund and decide to declare dividends for the full amount, they will pay out
$200,000, or $2.00 per preferred share. Because shares such as these are created with the intention of
continuity, the owner of this preferred stock can theoretically expect this dividend income stream in
perpetuity.
To place a current market value on this stream of future income, how much should an investor pay for one
share of this preferred stock? The calculation is a present value. The amount the investor pays today for that
one share is equal to the annual dividend (assuming it is declared and paid) divided by the rate of return. But
be careful—it is not the rate on the face of the preferred stock but therequired rate of return, the “market
rate” that investors expect from a stock of this level of risk. We must also note an important fact affecting all
2288 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments
Access for free at openstax.org

investment valuations: the value of an investment generally represents our expectations of all future cash
flows from that investment, discounted to today’s dollars.
Because a perpetuity is a stream of payments continuing indefinitely, determining the future value isn’t
possible. Determining the present value, however,ispossible, although one might wonder how. As we learned
earlier, the greater the amount of time used in a present value calculation, the smaller the amount of dollars
needed at the beginning, regardless of the interest rate involved. Therefore, when we discount each payment
in an infinite series, remembering that we would then add them together once we discount them to the
present, the infinite payments become negligible at some point and will no longer have a significant impact on
today’s value. To grow to one dollar 70 years from now, even at a growth rate of 5% per year, we would only
need $0.0329—not even four cents. Keeping all other facts the same, if we had 100 years to grow an
investment to one dollar, we would only need 0.76 cents—not even a whole penny! There is no question that
the effect of time is substantial and dramatic.
The study of perpetuities in corporate finance is a first step to understanding valuation models of certain
investments, such as the dividend discount model and the constant growth model, to be addressed in other
chapters. Our ability to discount future cash flows, even infinite cash flows, to a present value is a clue to the
price at which a company’s stock might trade. From a personal financial planning perspective, the individual
investor is also better able to be certain that they are paying a fair price for holdings in their portfolio. For
purposes of long-term or retirement planning, the investor must consider that a fixed and unchanging
dividend, such as from preferred stock, might not adequately protect the holder from inflation in times of
rising prices.
How to Value a Perpetuity
Given these facts, how do we place a value on a perpetuity? Let’s keep the preferred stock example for Shaw
Inc. in mind. The holder of one share will expect to receive a $2.00 dividend for every share owned. Although a
perpetuity may allow for growth of that dividend, we will hold that constant now. We must know one
additional fact: the required rate of return. This is our random variable, which can cause fluctuation in the
price of the preferred stock. Let’s assume that the required rate of return, which we’ll callR
S
, is 7%. This is the
rate of return that the market expects in order to take on the risk of an investment such as Shaw.
Determination of the price of Shaw’s preferred stock becomes quite simple because the expected annual cash
flow should not change, making it aconstant perpetuity. The constant perpetuity formula is
where PV is the price of the preferred stock,Cis the constant dividend, andR
s
is the required rate of return.
By substitution,
The price one should pay for a share of Shaw’s preferred stock is $28.57.
Here’s another constant perpetuity to try. The preferred stock of Rooney Corporation pays an annual dividend
of $1.75 per share. If the required rate of return in the market for shares such as Rooney’s is 5.8%, at what
price should these preferred shares be trading? The answer is, or $30.17.
Some investments might involve agrowing perpetuity. In this case, some degree of change in the amount of
the dividend is expected. The formula is altered slightly to include a rate of growth in the denominator, noted
asG, making the growing perpetuity formula
8.1 • Perpetuities229

To illustrate a growing perpetuity, let’s revisit Rooney Corp.’s stock, with its annual dividend of $1.75 and a
required rate of return in the market of 5.8%. If the expected dividend growth rateGis 1.2%, then the value
changes to, or $38.04. The expectation of growth in the dividend provides incentive for the
investor to pay a higher price.
THINK IT THROUGH
A Growing Perpetuity
Savo Corporation.While we think of perpetuities as being static, with a constant benefit or dividend, as
seen above, they might have the possibility of growth. Let’s assume that our preferred stock in Savo
Corporation is expected to grow at a rate of 0.2% per year. Its annual dividend per share is $4.00, and its
required rate of return in the market is 3%. If this is a constant dividend stock, like most preferred stock, its
price would be expected to approximate
or
When we factor in the 0.2% annual growth in the dividend, what does the price per share become?
Solution:
THINK IT THROUGH
College Endowment
In the case of an endowment for a college chair, as noted in the beginning of this section, instead of a
dividend amount for a preferred stock, we would use the desired amount of the distribution that the chair
would receive as part of their compensation package. Assume the college can invest this money at a fixed
3.5% annual rate. If you wish to gift the college enough funds to be held in perpetuity to produce $75,000
each year for that professor, how would you calculate this?
Solution:
We modify the constant perpetuity formula:
In one year, $2,142,857 grows to
The earnings (gift) of $75,000 are withdrawn to compensate the professor, and we are left with the amount
originally endowed, $2,142,857:

8.2Annuities
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define annuity.
•Distinguish between an ordinary annuity and an annuity due.
•Calculate the present value of an ordinary annuity and an annuity due.
•Explain how annuities may be used in lotteries and structured settlements.
•Explain how annuities might be used in retirement planning.
Calculating the Present Value of an Annuity
Anannuityis a stream of fixed periodic payments to be paid or received in the future. Present or future values
of these streams of payments can be calculated by applying time value of money formulas to each of these
payments. We’ll begin with determining the present value.
Before exploring present value, it’s helpful to analyze the behavior of a stream of payments over time. Assume
that we commit to a program of investing $1,000 at theendof each year for five years, earning 7%
compounded annually throughout. The high rate is locked in based partly on our commitment beginning
today, even though we will invest no money until the end of the first year. Refer to the timeline shown inTable
8.1.
Year012345
Balance Forward ($)0.000.001,000.002,070.003,214.904,439.94

Principal Added ($)1,000.001,000.001,000.001,000.001,000.00
New Balance ($)1,000.002,070.003,214.904,439.945,750.74
Table8.1
At the end of the first year, we deposit the first $1,000 in our fund. Therefore, it has not yet had an opportunity
to earn us any interest. The “new balance” number beneath is the cumulative amount in our fund, which then
carries to the top of the column for the next year. In year 2, that first amount will earn 7% interest, and at the
end of year 2, we add our second $1,000. Our cumulative balance is therefore $2,070, which then carries up to
the top of year 3 and becomes the basis of the interest calculation for that year. At the end of the fifth year,
our investing arrangement ends, and we’ve accumulated $5,750.74, of which $5,000 represents the money we
invested and the other $750.74 represents accrued interest on both our invested funds and the accumulated
interest from past periods.
Notice two important aspects that might appear counterintuitive: (1) we’ve “wasted” the first year because we
deposited no funds at the beginning of this plan, and our first $1,000 begins working for us only at the
beginning of the second year; and (2) our fifth and final investment earns no interest because it’s deposited at
the end of the last year. We will address these two issues from a practical application point of view shortly.
Keeping this illustration in mind, we will first focus on finding the present value of an annuity. Assume that you
wish to receive $25,000 each year from an existing fund for five years, beginning one year from now. This
stream of annual $25,000 payments represents an annuity. Because the first payment will be received one year
from now, we specifically call this anordinary annuity. We will look at an alternative to ordinary annuities
later. How much money do we need in our fund today to accomplish this stream of payments if our remaining
balance will always be earning 8% annually? Although we’ll gradually deplete the fund as we withdraw
periodic payments of the same amount, whatever funds remain in the account will always be earning interest.
8.2 • Annuities231

Before we investigate a formula to calculate this amount, we can illustrate the objective: determining the
present value of this future stream of payments, either manually or using Microsoft Excel. We can take each of
the five payments of $25,000 and discount them to today’s value using the simple present value formula:
where FV is the future value, PV is the present value,ris the interest rate, andnis the number of periods.
For example, the first $25,000 is discounted by the equation as follows:
Proof that $23,148.15 will grow to $25,000 in one year at 8% interest:
If we use this same method for each of the five years, increasing the exponentnfor each year, we see the
result inTable 8.2.

Table8.2Present Value of Future Payments
We begin with the amount calculated in our table, $99,818.76. Before any money is withdrawn, a year’s worth
of interest at 8% is compounded and added to our balance. Then our first $25,000 is withdrawn, leaving us
with $82,804.26. This process continues until the end of five years, when, aside from a minor rounding
difference, the fund has “done its job” and is equal to zero. However, we can make this simpler. Because each
payment withdrawn (or added, as we will see later) is the same, we can calculate the present value of an
annuity in one step using an equation. Rather than the multiple steps above, we will use the following
equation:
where PVa is the present value of the annuity and PYMT is the amount of one payment.
In this example, PYMT is $25,000 at the end of each of five years. Note that the greater the number of periods
and/or the size of the amount borrowed, the greater the chances of large rounding errors. We have used six
decimal places in our calculations, though the actual time value of money factor, combining interest and time,
can be much longer. Therefore, our solutions will often use ≅ r ather than the equal sign.
By substitution, and then following the proper order of operations:

In both cases, barring a rounding difference caused by decimal expansion, we come to the same result using
the equation as when we calculate each of multiple years. It’s important to note that rounding differences can
become significant when dealing with larger multipliers, as in the financing of a multimillion-dollar machine or
facility. In this text, we will ignore them.
In conclusion, five payments of $25,000, or $125,000 in total, can be funded today with $99,817.81, with the
difference being obtained from interest always accumulating on the remaining balance at 8%. The running
balance is obtained by calculating the year’s interest on the previous balance, adding it to that balance, and
subtracting the $25,000 that is withdrawn on the last day of the year. In the last (fifth) year, just enough
interest will accrue to bring the balance to the $25,000 needed to complete the fifth payment.
A common use of the PVa is with large-money lotteries. Let’s assume you win the North Dakota Lottery for
$1.2 million, and they offer you $120,000 per year for 10 years, beginning one year from today. We will ignore
taxes and other nonmathematical considerations throughout these discussions and problems. The Lottery
Commission will likely contact you with an alternative: would you like to accept that stream of payments ... or
would you like to accept alump sumof $787,000 right now instead? Can you complete a money-based
analysis of these alternatives? Based purely on the dollars, no, you cannot. The reason is that you can’t
compare future amounts to present amounts without considering the effect of time—that is, the time value of
money. Therefore, we need an interest rate that we can use as a discounting factor to place these alternatives
on the same playing field by expressing them in terms of today’s dollars, the present value. Let’s use 9%. If we
discount the future stream of fixed payments (an ordinary annuity, as the payments are identical and they
begin one year from now), we can then compare that result to the cash lump sum that the Lottery Commission
is offering you instead.
By substitution, and following the proper order of operations:
All things being equal, that expected future stream of ten $120,000 payments is worth approximately $770,119
today. Now you can compare like numbers, and the $787,000 cash lump sum is worth more than the
discounted future payments. That is the choice one would accept without considering such aspects as
taxation, desire, need, confidence in receiving the future payments, or other variables.

Calculating the Present Value of an Annuity Due
Earlier, we defined an ordinary annuity.A variation is theannuity due. The difference between the two is one
period. That’s all—just one additional period of interest. An ordinary annuity assumes that there is a one-
period lag between the start of a stream of payments and the actual first payment. In contrast, an annuity due
assumes that payments begin immediately, as in the lottery example above. We would assume that you would
receive the first annual lottery check of $120,000 immediately, not a year from now. In summary, whether
calculating future value (covered in the next section) or present value of an annuity due, the one-year lag is
eliminated, and we begin immediately.
Since the difference is simply one additional period of time, we can adjust for this easily by taking the formula
for an ordinary annuity and multiplying by one additional period. One more period, of course, is (1 +i). Recall
fromTime Value of Money Ithat the formula for compounding is (1 +i)
N
, whereiis the interest rate andNis
the number of periods. The superscriptNdoes not apply because it represents 1, for one additional period,
and the power of 1 can be ignored. Therefore, faced with an annuity due problem, we solve as if it were an
ordinary annuity, but we multiply by (1 +i) one more time.
In our original example from this section, we wished to withdraw $25,000 each year for five years from a fund
that we would establish now. We determined how much that fund should be worth today if we intend to
receive our first payment one year from now. Throughout this fund’s life, it will earn 8% annually. This time,
let’s assume we’ll withdraw our first payment immediately, at point zero, making this an annuity due. Because
we’re trying to determine how much our starting balance should be, it makes sense that we must begin with a
larger number. Why? Because we’re pulling our first payment out immediately, so less money will remain to
start compounding to the amount we need to fund all five of our planned payments! Our rule can be stated as
follows:
Whether one is calculating present value or future value, the result of an annuity due must always be larger
than that of an ordinary annuity, all other facts remaining constant. Here is the stream of solutions for the
example above, but please notice that we will multiply by (1 +i), one additional period, following the same
order of operations:
That’s how much we must start our fund with today, before we earn any interest or draw out any money. Note
that it’s larger than the $99,817.81 that would be required for an ordinary annuity. It must be, because we’re
about to diminish our compounding power with an immediate withdrawal, so we have to begin with a larger
amount.
We notice several things:
1.The formula must change because the annual payment is subtracted first, prior to the calculation of
annual interest.
2.We accomplish the same result, aside from an insignificant rounding difference: the fund is depleted once
the last payment is withdrawn.
3.The last payment is withdrawn on the first day of the final year, not the last. Therefore, no interest is
earned during the fifth and final year.

To reinforce this, let’s use the same approach for our lottery example above. Reviewing the facts, you have a
choice of receiving 10 annual payments of your $1.2 million winnings, each worth $120,000, and you discount
at a rate of 9%. The only difference is that this time, you can receive your first $120,000 right away; you don’t
have to wait a year. This is now an annuity due. We solve it just as before, except that we multiply by one
additional period of interest, (1 +i):
Again, this result must be larger than the amount we determined when this was calculated as an ordinary
annuity.
The calculations above, representing the present values of ordinary annuities and annuities due, have been
presented on an annual basis. InTime Value of Money I, we saw that compounding and discounting
calculations can be based on non-annual periods as well, such as quarterly or monthly compounding and
discounting. This aspect, quite common in periodic payment calculations, will be explored in a later section of
this chapter.
Calculating Annuities Used in Structured Settlements
In addition to lottery payouts, annuity calculations are often used instructured settlementsby attorneys at
law. If you win a $450,000 settlement for an insurance claim, the opposing party may ask you to accept an
annuity so that they can pay you in installments rather than a lump sum of cash. What would a fair cash
distribution by year mean? If you have a preferreddiscount rate(the percentage we all must know to
calculate the time value of money) of 6% and you expect equal distributions of $45,000 over 10 years,
beginning one year from now, you can use the present value of an annuity formula to compare the
alternatives:
By substitution:
If the opposing attorney offered you a lump sum of cash less than that, all things equal, you would refuse it; if
8.2 • Annuities235

the lump sum were greater than that, you would likely accept it.
What if you negotiate the first payment to be made to you immediately, turning this ordinary annuity into an
annuity due? As noted above, we simply multiply by one additional period of interest, (1 + 0.06). Repeating the
last step of the solution above and then multiplying by (1 + 0.06), we determine that
You would insist on that number as an absolute minimum before you would consider accepting the offered
stream of payments.
To further verify that ordinary annuity can be converted into an annuity due by multiplying the solution by one
additional period’s worth of interest before applying the annuity factor to the payment, we can divide the
difference between the two results by the value of the original annuity. When the result is expressed as a
percent, it must be the same as the rate of interest used in the annuity calculations. Using our example of an
annuity with five payments of $25,000 at 8%, we compare the present values of the ordinary annuity of
$99,817.81 and the annuity due of $107,803.24.
The result shows that the present value of the annuity due is 8% higher than the present value of the ordinary
annuity.
Calculating the Future Value of an Annuity
In the previous section, we addressed discounting a periodic stream of payments from the future to the
present. We are also interested in how to project the future value of a series of payments. In this case, an
investment may be made periodically. Keeping with the definition of an annuity, if the amount of periodic
investment is always the same, we may take a one-step shortcut to calculate the future value of that stream by
using the formula presented below:
where FVa is the future value of the annuity, PYMT is a one-time payment or receipt in the series,ris the
interest rate, andnis the number of periods.
As we did in our section on present values of annuities, we will begin with an ordinary annuity and then
proceed to an annuity due.
Let’s assume that you lock in a contract for an investment opportunity at 4% per year, but you cannot make
the first investment until one year from now. This is counterintuitive for an investor, perhaps, but because it is
the basis of the formula and procedures for ordinary annuities, we will accept this assumption. You plan to
invest $3,000 at the end of each year. How much money will you have at the end of five years?
Let’s start by placing this on a timeline like the one appearing earlier in this chapter (seeTable 8.3):
Year012345

As we explained earlier when describing ordinary annuities, the payment for year 1 is not invested until the
last day of that year, so year 1 is wasted as a compounding opportunity. Therefore, the amount only
compounds for four years rather than five. Also, our fifth payment is not made until the last day of our
contract in year 5, so it has no chance to earn a compounded future value. The investor has lost on both ends.
In the table above, we have made five calculations, and for a longer-term contract such as 10, 25, or 40 years,
this would be tedious. Fortunately, as with present values, this ordinary annuity can be solved in one step
because all payments are identical.
Repeating the formula, and then by substitution:
This proof emphasizes that year 1 is wasted, with no compounding because the payment is made on the last
day of year 1 rather than immediately. We lose compounding through this ordinary annuity in another way:
year 5’s investment is made on the last day of this five-year contract and has no chance to accumulate interest.
A more intuitive method would be to enter a contract for an annuity due so that our first payment can be
made immediately. In this way, we don’t waste the first year, and all five payments work in year 5 as well. As
stated previously, this means that annuities due will yield larger results than ordinary annuities, whether one is
discounting (PVa) or compounding (FVa).
Let’s hold all facts constant with the previous example, except that we will invest at the beginning of each year,
starting immediately upon locking in this five-year contract. We follow the same technique as in the present
value section: we multiply by one additional period to convert this ordinary annuity factor into a factor for an
annuity due. Whether one is solving for a future value or a present value, the result of an annuity due must
always be larger than an ordinary annuity. With future value, we begin investing immediately, so the result will
be larger than if we waited for a period to elapse. With present value, we begin extracting funds immediately
rather than letting them work for us during the first year, so logically we would have to start with more.
Continuing our example but converting it to an annuity due, we will multiply by one additional period, (1 +i).
All else remains the same:
Let’s provide one additional example of each. Assume that you have a chance to invest $15,000 per year for 10
years, earning 8% compounded annually. What amount would you have after the 10 years? If we can only
make our first payment at the end of each year, our ending value will be
However, if we can make our first payment immediately and then make subsequent payments at the start of
8.2 • Annuities237

each following year, we modify the formula above by multiplying the annual payment by one additional
period:
THINK IT THROUGH
Begin an Investing Program at Age 20 or 30?
In this chapter’s introductory section,Why It Matters, we posed a question about pledging to invest $1,000
each year until you reach age 60. If you can earn a 5% annual rate of interest, how much will you have if you
begin at age 20? What if you delay this program until age 30? The additional 10 years can make a
surprisingly large difference. How can you calculate that difference?
Solution:
Perform two separate calculations comparable to the chapter examples above, using the formula for the
future value of an ordinary annuity. You plan to make the first investment immediately, making this an
annuity due, so you will multiply by one additional period, (1 + 0.05). Notice that the only difference
between the two calculations is the exponentN, representing the number of periods.
Thirty years (starting at age 30):
Forty years (starting at age 20):
Waiting 10 years before committing to this program comes with a surprisingly high cost—a loss of almost
82% of the potential value.
How Annuities Are Used for Retirement Planning
On a final note, how might annuities be used forretirement planning? A person might receive a lump-sum
windfall from an investment, and rather than choosing to accept the proceeds, they might decide to invest the
sum (ignoring taxes) in an annuity. Their intention is to let this invested sum produce annual distributions to
supplement Social Security payments. Assume the recipient just received $75,000, again ignoring tax effects.
They have the chance to invest in an annuity that will provide a distribution at the end of each of the next five
years, and that annuity contract provides interest at 3% annually. Their first receipt will be one year from now.
This is an ordinary annuity.
We can also solve for the payment given the other variables, an important aspect of financial analysis. If the
person with the $75,000 windfall wants this fund to last five years and they can earn 3%, then how much can
they withdraw from this fund each year? To solve this question, we can apply the present value of an annuity
formula. This time, the payment (PYMT) is the unknown, and we know that the PVa, or the present value that
they have at this moment, is $75,000:
2388 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments
Access for free at openstax.org

The person can withdraw this amount every year beginning one year from now, and when the final payment is
withdrawn, the fund will be depleted. Interest accrues each year on the beginning balance, and then
$16,376.60 is withdrawn at the end of each year.

8.3Loan Amortization
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Distinguish between different types of loans.
•Explain how amortization works.
•Create an amortization schedule.
•Calculate the cost of borrowing.
Types of Loans
Funds can be loaned to businesses of any type, including corporations, partnerships, limited liability
companies, and proprietorships. Bankers often refer to these lending structures asfacilities, and they can be
tailored to the specific needs of the borrower in a number of ways. Similarly, lenders develop loans and lines of
credit for individuals. Whether for a business or an individual, the purpose of the loan, method of repayment,
interest rate, specific terms, and time involved must all be tailored to the goals of the borrower and the lender.
In this chapter, we will focus on fixed-rate loans, although other alternatives exist.
Typical business loans include the following:
•Term loansgenerally bear a maturity date and a set rate of interest and are typically used to finance
investments in assets such as equipment, buildings, and possibly other acquired firms. The length of the
term loan is generally designed to match the useful life of the asset being financed, and it will usually be
repaid on a monthly schedule. It’s common for a term loan to be backed by collateral, such as the asset
itself or other assets of the business.
•Revolving lines of credit (revolvers), are used to finance the short-term working capital needs of a
business. Revolvers will have a specific maximum but no set schedule of monthly payments. Interest
accrues on the amount of cash that a company has drawn down from the facility. These credit lines may
be secured by accounts receivable, inventory, other assets of the business, or sometimes simply the good
8.3 • Loan Amortization239

faith and credit of the company if the firm is strong, creditworthy, and established with the lender.
Revolvers must often be fully repaid and unused for a short period of time to assure the lender that the
borrower is not using this facility for longer-term needs.
Personal loans also come in several types, designed for the purpose the borrower (consumer) has in mind,
with assistance from the lender in determining the appropriate structure:
•Personal lines of creditare similar to lines of credit on bank cards, with interest being charged on the
outstanding balance of the credit line. These are available on the basis of personal credit scores, with data
being supplied by the three best-known credit reporting firms:Experian,Equifax, andTransUnion.
Individuals should check their scores with each of these companies at least once per year, which they can
do for no charge. Additional requests from the same company require a small fee.
•Anunsecured personal loanis an installment loan, initially drawn for a fixed amount and repaid on a
periodic schedule with interest, as we have seen in our annuity examples. Unsecured means that the loan
is not secured by collateral but is instead based on the strong credit history of the borrower.
•In contrast, asecured personal loanhas an asset backing up the unpaid amount, and if the consumer
defaults on the debt, the asset can be seized by the lender to satisfy their claim. A common example is an
auto loan, which is secured by the car being purchased; nonpayment or default on the loan can lead to the
borrower’s car being repossessed.
•Amortgage loanis another type of secured personal loan, but for a longer period, such as 20, 25, or even
30 years. The home being purchased or built is the collateral, and the home may be foreclosed upon if the
borrower defaults. Full title to the home typically remains with the lender as long as an unpaid balance
remains on the debt.
•Student loansare borrowings intended to fund college or career education, and they can come from a
financial institution or the federal government. Interest rates on these loans are generally low and
advantageous, and repayment does not begin until after the borrower’s education is complete (or if they
drop below a certain level of time status, such as becoming a half-time student).
Calculating Loan Payments Using Simple Amortization
Loan amortizationrefers to a schedule of how and when a debt will be repaid with interest. As noted, we will
focus on fixed-rate debts, such as auto loans, personal loans with installment payments, or mortgages. Before
entering into a borrowing agreement, the borrower can use any of a number of tools to verify the terms being
offered, such as the monthly payment on a car loan financed by the dealer. In many cases, this is
accomplished by using the present value of an annuity formula:
We’ve already reviewed the present value of ordinary annuities in several examples. Before we look into
business or consumer loans and their repayment, we must review an area ofTime Value of Money I.
We’re not likely to make annual payments on a home mortgage or auto loan, as these are commonly paid on a
monthly basis. Fortunately, our formulas are easily adjusted from annual to non-annual periods. You will recall
that we solve for non-annual periods in the same way, with two adjustments: (1) we divide the annual interest
rate by the number of periods in the year, and (2) we multiply the time periods by the number of those periods
within a year. Therefore, in the case of monthly debt service, including interest and principal, we use 12
periods.
Given a three-year car loan at 6%, rather than using 6% and 3 periods in our formula, we would instead use
0.5% (6% ÷ 12) and 36 periods (3 years × 12), and then apply the present value of an annuity formula in the
same way. Let’s say the three-year, 6% auto loan is for $32,000. You need to know if you can squeeze the
monthly payment into your budget. For our examples, we will ignore any other charges, fees, taxes, or extras
that your lender might include in these payments, and we will focus only on interest and principal repayment.

You will make the first payment one month from now, making this an ordinary annuity. What is the amount of
your monthly debt service? In this case, you would be solving for a different unknown: the payment amount.
By substitution into the present value of an annuity formula, adjusting for monthly payments as noted:
Dividing both sides by 32.781 to isolate the payment amount (PYMT) gives us
Solving for the payment, we find that it’s approximately $973.50 per month. You consult your monthly budget
and find that you can cover this monthly payment, so you conclude the deal. Ask the salesperson for the
amortization table on this debt to show how your 36 payments of $973.50 will cover your interest plus
repayment of the principal amount of the debt. At this point, you know how to complete your own table. Using
a financial calculator or Microsoft Excel simplifies the operation above to a few keystrokes, as presented later
in this chapter.
Two extracts from an amortization table are shown inTable 8.4.

Table8.4Extracts from an Amortization Table ($)
This table resembles proofs we have seen of annuities, but let’s focus on some details:
1.Each fixed payment contains both interest and principal repayment.
2.Because the payments are fixed and the amount of remaining debt is decreasing, the monthly interest
portion is always decreasing, and the amount of principal payment therefore must be increasing.
We can conclude that the lender is making more of their revenue (interest) in the early months than in the
later months. In addition, the debt is decreasing slowly in the early months and more rapidly in the later
8.3 • Loan Amortization241

months. We can all agree that lenders are compensated for the risks they take earlier rather than later. Of the
36 payments of $973.50, $32,000 has been repaid as the principal borrowed. The remaining $3,046.08 is the
lender’s revenue, the cost of credit.
For an additional example, one that drives home the point that more interest is paid in the early months of a
long-term loan, we will consider a 20-year home mortgage. Home mortgage payments are typically made
monthly, and again, we will ignore additional charges by the lender, such as real estate tax and homeowner’s
insurance. Let’s assume you buy a $200,000 home, pay $60,000 as a cash deposit, and will finance the
remaining $140,000 over 20 years. The bank offers you a 3.6% annual interest rate. What will the amount of
your monthly payment be for the interest and principal repayment? The bank will tell you, of course, but let’s
prove it for ourselves. We’ll do it in exactly the same fashion as the car loan above, using the present value of
an annuity formula. Remember that you are not financing the entire $200,000 purchase; you pay $60,000 in
cash, so you are only financing the remaining $140,000.
We modify the periods from years to months by multiplying by 12, and we modify the annual rate to a monthly
rate by dividing by 12, resulting in
By substitution into the present value of an annuity formula:
We divide both sides by 170.907667 to isolate the payment amount (PYMT):
Your monthly mortgage payment is $819.16. As in our auto loan example, we’ll complete an amortization table
of our own—though, of course, you’ll remember to ask your lender for their version. Extracts from a full
240-month table are shown inTable 8.5below. The front-end packing of interest revenue is more obvious here
because of the longer time period.

Table8.5Amortization Table for a Mortgage ($)
As with your car loan, earlier payments contain more interest than loan repayment, so the lender’s revenue is
at a significant peak in the early years. The length of the loan, coupled with the frequent compounding,
emphasizes this. In month 10, the interest and principal amounts “pass” each other, and now the loan balance
is dropping at a quicker rate. Finally, note that you will pay more than $56,000 to finance this $140,000
borrowing. If you pay off this mortgage over 240 months as planned, the interest cost represents an additional
28% of the full cost of the home!
If the borrower has the means to make an accelerated payment against this debt—for example, due to a
bonus or other windfall—doing so can make a significant difference in the total cost of financing over the life
of the loan. Assume that after three years (month 36), you receive a bonus of $2,000 and decide to apply the
entire amount to prepay the remaining balance. Your loan agreement allows you to apply the entire amount to
the remaining unpaid balance of the mortgage. While this might seem equal to just 2.5 months’ worth of
payment, the debt is fully paid off almost 6 months ahead of schedule, and total interest is reduced from over
$56,000 to $55,000. The ability to prepay long-term debts such as this is clearly worth negotiating initially.
8.4Stated versus Effective Rates
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain the difference between stated and effective rates.
•Calculate the true cost of borrowing.
The Difference between Stated and Effective Rates
If you look at the bottom of your monthly credit card statement, you could see language such as “The interest
rate on unpaid balances is 1.5% per month.” You might think to yourself, “So, that’s 12 months times 1.5%, or
18% per year.” This is a fine example of the difference betweenstatedandeffectiveannual interest rates. The
effective interest ratereflects compounding within a one-year period, an important distinction because we
tend to focus on annual interest rates. Because compounding occurs more than once per year, the true annual
rate is higher than appears. Please remember that if interest is calculated and compounded annually, the
stated and effective interest rates will be the same. Keep in mind that the following principles work whether
you are the debtor paying off an obligation or an investor hoping for more frequent compounding. The
dynamics of the time value of money apply in either direction.
Effective Rates and Period of Compounding
Let’s remain with our example of a credit card statement that indicates an interest rate of 1.5% per month on

unpaid balances. If you use this card only once, to make a $1,000 purchase in January, and then fail to pay the
bill when it comes due, the issuer will bill you $15. Now you owe them $1,015. Assume you completely ignore
this bill and never pay it throughout the rest of the year. The monthly calculation of interest starts to
compound on past interest assessments in addition to the $1,000 initial purchase (seeTable 8.6).

Interest on a Credit Card
Statement ($)
Because interest compounds monthly rather than annually, the effective annual rate is 19.56%, not the
intuitive rate of the stated 1.5% times 12 months, or 18%. Our basic compounding formula of(1+i)^nby
substitution shows:
To isolate the effective annual rate, we then deduct 1 because our interest calculations are based on the value
of $1:
Therefore, it falls to the consumer/borrower to understand the true cost of borrowing, especially when larger
dollar amounts are involved. If we had been dealing with $10,000 rather than $1,000, the annual difference
would be more than $156.
LINK TO LEARNING
A Helpful Demonstration . . .
From theCorporate Finance Institute(https://openstax.org/r/Corporate_Finance_Institute)comes a fine
visual of a similar example. Here, we see the effective annual rate that results from taking a nominal annual
rate of 12%, with a benefit to an investor if they have the benefit of monthly compounding.
One example of the importance of understanding effective interest rates is an invention from the early 1990s:

thepayday advance loan (PAL). The practice of offering such loans can be controversial because it can lead to
very high rates of interest, perhaps even illegally high, in an act known as usury. Although some states have
outlawed PALs and others place limits on them, some do not. A PAL is a short-term loan in anticipation of a
person’s next paycheck. A person in need of money for short-term needs will write a check on Thursday but
date the checknextThursday, which is their normal payday; assume this transaction is for $200. The lender,
typically operating from a storefront, will advance the $200 cash and hold the postdated check. The lender
charges a fee—let’s say $14—as their compensation. The following Thursday, the borrower is expected to pay
off the advance, and if they do not, the lender can deposit the postdated check. If that check has insufficient
funds, more fees and penalties will likely be assessed.
One primary reason that arrangements such as these are controversial is the excessively high nominal (stated)
interest rate that they can represent. For a one-week loan of $200, the borrower is paying $14, or 7% of the
borrowed amount. If this is annualized, with 52 seven-day periods in a year, the stated rate is 364%! While a
PAL might seem to be an effective immediate solution to a cash shortfall, the mathematics behind the true
cost of borrowing simply do not make sense, and a person who uses such arrangements regularly is placing
themselves at a dreadful financial disadvantage.
THINK IT THROUGH
How Tempting Is That Refund Anticipation?
Refund anticipation loans (RALs)began in 1987, and they are still available (though not from banks) and
used by millions of people.
1
Now, RALs come from private lending chains. These loans allow you to
determine your April 15 personal income tax liability through a preparer and receive an advance against
your expected refund.
2
But beware: your ability to analyze the true cost of money is always critical. Like all
loans, RALs bear a rate of interest. Let’s assume that the firm that prepared your tax return determines that
you’re entitled to an $800 refund. Once they advance that amount to you, it will bear interest at a certain
rate; we’ll assume 0.5% per week. You might expect a tax refund in four weeks. Half a percent of $800
doesn’t sound like much, but what happens when you annualize it into an effective rate, assuming your tax
refund arrives exactly four weeks from when you accept the loan? Assume no compounding during those
four weeks.
Solution:
A weekly rate of 0.5% on the $800 advance is $4 per week, so for four full weeks, you’ve paid $16 for the use
of $800. Of course, that totals 2% of the amount advanced. There are 13 four-week periods in a year, so
even though the interest rate appears to be small, it amounts to 26% when annualized! We assumed no
compounding to keep the illustration simple, but we further assume that you are not using this advance
throughout the year. If you were, then periodic compounding would drive the effective rate even higher, to
just over 29.3%.

Solving Time Value of Money Problems Using a Financial Calculator
Since the 1980s, many convenient and inexpensive tools have become available to simplify business and
personal calculations, including personal computers with financial applications and handheld/desktop or
online calculators with many of the functions we’ve studied already. This section will explore examples of both,
beginning with financial calculators. While understanding and mastery of the use of time value of money
equations are part of a solid foundation in the study of business and personal finance, calculators are rapid
and efficient.
We’ll begin with the constant perpetuity that we used to illustrate the constant perpetuity formula. A share of
preferred stock of Shaw Inc., pays an annual $2.00 dividend, and the required rate of return that investors in
this stock expect is 7%. The simple technique to solve this problem using the calculator is shown inTable 8.7.

Earlier we solved for the present value of a 5-year ordinary annuity of $25,000 earning 8% annually. We then
solved for an annuity due, all other facts remaining the same. The two solutions were $99,817.50 and
$107,802.50, respectively. We enter our variables as shown inTable 8.8to solve for an ordinary annuity:

Note that the default setting on the financial calculator is END to indicate that payment is made at the end of a
period, as in our ordinary annuity. In addition, we follow the payment amount of $25,000 with the +/-
keystroke—an optional step to see the final present value result as a positive value.
To perform the same calculation as an annuity due, we can perform the same procedures as above, but with
two additional steps after Step 1 to change the default from payments at the end of each period to payments
at the beginning of each period (seeTable 8.9).

Earlier in the chapter, we explored the effect of interannual compounding on the true cost of money, recalling
the basic compounding formula:
We saw that when modified for monthly compounding at a stated rate of 1.5%, the actual (effective) rate of
interest per year was 19.56%. One simple way to prove this is by using the calculator keystrokes listed inTable

Had we assumed that the stated monthly interest rate of 1.5% could be simply multiplied by 12 months for an
annual rate of 18%, we would be ignoring the effect of more frequent compounding. As indicated above, the
annual interest on the money that we spent initially, accumulating at a rate of 1.5%per month, is 19.56%, not
18%:
The final example in this chapter will represent the amortization of a loan. Using a 36-month auto loan for
$32,000 at 6% per year compounded monthly, we can easily find the monthly payment and the amortization of
this loan on our calculator using the following procedures and keystrokes.

Solving Time Value of Money Problems Using Excel
Microsoft’s popular spreadsheet program Excel is arguably one of the most common and powerful numeric
and data analysis products available. Yet while mastery of Excel requires extensive study and practice, enough
basics can be learned in two or three hours to provide the user with the ability to solve problems quickly and
conveniently, including extensive financial capability. Most of the calculations in this chapter were prepared
with Excel.
The boxes in the Excel gridwork, known individually as cells (located at the intersection of a column and a row),
can contain numbers, text, and very powerful formulas (or functions) for calculations and data analytics. Cells,
rows, columns, and groups of cells (ranges) are easily moved, formatted, and replicated. In the mortgage
amortization table for 240 months seen in Section 8.3.2, only the formulas for month 1 were typed in. With one
simple command, that row of formulas was replicated 239 more times, with each line updating itself with
relevant number adjustments automatically. With some practice, a long table such as that can be constructed
by even a relatively new user in less than 10 minutes.
In this section, we will illustrate how to use Excel to solve problems from earlier in the chapter, including
perpetuities, ordinary annuities, effective interest rates, and loan amortization. We will omit the basic
dynamics of an Excel spreadsheet because they were presented sufficiently in preceding chapters.
Revisiting the constant perpetuity from Section 8.1, in which our shares of Shaw Inc., preferred stock pay an
annual fixed dividend of $2.00 and the required rate of return is 7%, we do not use an Excel function for this
simple operation. The two values are entered in cells B3 and B4, respectively.
We enter a formula in cell B6 to perform the division and display the result in that cell. The actual contents of
cell B6 are typed below it for your reference, in cell B8 (seeFigure 8.2).

Download thespreadsheet file(https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet_file_Chapter08_finance)containing
key Chapter 8 Excel exhibits.
To find the present value of an ordinary annuity, we revisit Section 8.2.1. You will draw $25,000 at the end of
each year for five years from a fund earning 8% annually, and you want to know how much you need in that
fund today to accomplish this. We accomplish this in Excel easily with the PV function. The format of the PV
command is
=PV(rate,periods,payment,0,0)
Only the first three arguments inside the parentheses are used. We’ll place them in cells and refer to those
cells in our PV function. As an option, you could also type the numbers into the parentheses directly. Notice
the slight rounding error because of decimal expansion. Also, the payment must be entered as a negative
number for your result to be positive; this can be accomplished either by making the $25,000 in cell B5 a
negative amount or by placing a minus sign in front of the B5 in the formula’s arguments. In cell B3, you must
enter the percent either as 0.08 or as 8% (with the percent sign). We repeated the formula syntax and the
actual formula inputs in column A near the result, for your reference (seeFigure 8.3).
Figure8.3Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity
We also found the present value of an annuity due. We use the same information from the ordinary annuity
problem above, but you will recall that the first of five payments happens immediately at the start of year 1,
not at the end. We follow the same procedures and inputs as in the previous example, but with one change to
the PV function: the last argument in the parentheses will change from 0 to 1. This is a toggle switch that
commands the PV function to treat this as an annuity due instead of an ordinary annuity (seeFigure 8.4).

Figure8.4Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Annuity Due
Section 8.2introduced us to future values. Comparable to the PV function above, Excel provides the FV
function. Using the same information—$3,000 invested annually for five years, starting one year from now, at
4%—we’ll solve using Excel (seeFigure 8.5). The format of the command is
=FV(rate,periods,payment,0,0)
Figure8.5Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity
As with present values, using the same data but solving for an annuity due requires the fifth argument inside
the parentheses to be changed from 0 to 1; all other values remain the same (seeFigure 8.6).
Figure8.6Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Future Value of an Annuity Due
InSection 8.4, we explained the difference between stated and effective rates of interest to show the true cost
of borrowing, in this case for a one-year period, if interest is compounded for periods within a year. The syntax
for the Excel effect function to calculate this rate is
=EFFECT(rate,periods)
8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel251

whererateis the nominal rate andperiodsrepresents the number of periods within a year.
Earlier, our example showed that 1.5% compounded monthly results in not 18% per year but actually over
19.56% (seeFigure 8.7).
Figure8.7Excel Spreadsheet Showing Effective Interest Rate
Note several things: First, the nominal interest rate is entered as a percent. Second, the actual effect function
in C7 is typed as =EFFECT(rate,B7); we use the wordratebecause we actually assigned a name to cell B3, so
Excel can use it in a function and replicate it without it changing. When cell C7 is replicated to C8 and C9,rate
remains the same, but the formulas automatically adjust to use B8 and B9 for the periods.
To assign a name to a cell, keep in mind that every cell has column-row coordinates. We want cell B3 to be the
anchor of our effective rate calculations. Rather than referring to cell B3, we can name it, and in this case, we
use the namerate, which we can then use in formulas like any other Excel cell letter-number reference. Place
the cursor in cell B3. Now, look at cell A1 on the grid: right above that cell, you see a box displaying B3, the
current cursor location. If you click in that box and type “rate” (without the quotation marks), as we did, then
hit the enter key, the value in that box will change torate. Now, if you type “rate” (again, without quotation
marks) into a formula, Excel knows to use the contents of cell B3.
Excel provides convenient tools for figuring out amortization. We’ll revisit our 36-month auto loan for $32,000
at 6% per year, compounded monthly. A loan amortization table for a fixed interest rate debt is usually
formatted as follows, with the Interest and Principal columns interchangeable:
PeriodPaymentInterestPrincipalBalance
In Excel, a table is completed by using the function PMT. The individual steps follow.
1.List the information about the loan in the upper left of the worksheet, and create the column headings for
the schedule of amortization. Type “B5” (without the quotation marks) in cell E9 to begin the schedule.
Then enter 1 for the first month under the Payment # (or Month) column, in cell A10 (seeFigure 8.8).
2528 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments
Access for free at openstax.org

Figure8.8Step 1 of Creating an Amortization Table
2.Next, in cell B10, the payment is derived from the formula =PMT(rate,periods,pv), with PV representing the
present value, or the loan amount. Because we are compounding monthly, enter C$2 and C$3 for the rate
and periods, respectively. Cell B5 is used for the loan amount, but notice the optional minus sign placed in
front of the entry B$5; this causes the results in the schedule to be displayed as positive numbers. The
dollar sign ($) inserted in the cell references forces Excel to “freeze” those locations so that they don’t
attempt to update when we replicate them later; this is known in spreadsheet programs as anabsolute
reference(seeFigure 8.9).
Figure8.9Step 2 of Creating an Amortization Table
3.The next step is to calculate the interest. We take the remaining balance from the previous line, in this
case cell E9, and multiply it by the monthly interest rate in cell C2, typing C$2 to lock in the reference. The
remaining balance of the loan should always be multiplied by this monthly percentage (seeFigure 8.10).
8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel253

Figure8.10Step 3 of Creating an Amortization Table
4.Because this is a fixed-rate loan, whatever is left from each payment after first deducting the interest
represents principal, the amount by which the balance of the outstanding loan balance is reduced.
Therefore, the contents of cell D10 represent B10, the total payment, minus C10, the interest portion (see
Figure 8.11). No dollar signs are included because this cell reference can adjust to each row into which this
formula is replicated, as will be seen in the following examples.
Figure8.11Step 4 of Creating an Amortization Table
5.Because our principal portion of the last payment has reduced our outstanding balance, it is subtracted
from the preceding balance in cell E9 (seeFigure 8.12). The command therefore is=E9-D10.

Figure8.12Step 5 of Creating an Amortization Table
Now that the first full row is defined, an amortization schedule is easily developed by Excel’s replication
abilities. Place the cursor on cell A10, hold down the left mouse button, and drag the cursor to cell E10. Cells
A10 through E10 in row 10 should now be highlighted. Release the mouse button. Then “grab” the tiny square
symbol at the bottom right of cell E10 and drag it downward as far as you need; in this case, you’ll need 35
more rows because this is a 36-month loan, so it will end at row 45. We added a line for totals.
This is now a complete loan amortization schedule (seeFigure 8.13). The first several periods display, followed
by the last few periods, to prove that the schedule is complete (data rows for month 4 to month 22 are
hidden).
Figure8.13Completed Amortization Schedule
This will look familiar; it’s the same amortization table used as a proof in Section 8.3 (seeTable 8.4). There is no
rounding error because Excel uses the full decimal expansion in its calculations.

Summary
8.1Perpetuities
A perpetuity is an investment that is intended to provide an expected return indefinitely, either remaining
constant or growing by an incremental amount. Preferred stock is a common example with a preestablished
dividend formula. An indefinite stream of payments cannot be compounded into a future value, but it can be
discounted to a present value, providing an opportunity to determine the amount an investor should be
willing to pay for a share of that stock.
8.2Annuities
An annuity is a stream of fixed periodic payments that is expected to be paid or received. Calculations of future
value or present value are commonly performed on these payment streams for a wide number of reasons in
business and personal financial analysis, as seen in the chapter focusing on single amounts, particularly in
loan repayment. Annuities may be ordinary annuities, in which the first cash flow of a series occurs at the end
of the first period, or annuities due, if the first cash flow occurs at the beginning point of the first period.
8.3Loan Amortization
Loans are contracts between a lender and a borrower. Failure to observe the rules of that contract, such as
payment of interest or repayment of the amount owed, can subject the borrower to substantial penalties as
well as damage to their credit. Loan agreements bearing a fixed rate of interest have a scheduled
amortization, or rate and time of repayments with interest. Several types of business and personal loans were
described.
8.4Stated versus Effective Rates
For a borrower to understand the true cost of financing, they must be familiar with interannual compounding,
which can cause a stated interest rate that appears to be annual to actually be higher. The effective rate of
interest was demonstrated to understand that true cost.
8.5Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel

Problems
Use four decimal places on time value of money factors unless otherwise specified. Approximations and minor
differences because of rounding are acceptable. Ignore the effect of taxes. Assume that all percentages are
annual rates and that compounding occurs annually unless indicated otherwise.
1.Steve purchases preferred stock in Berklee Corporation, with each share paying a $2.50 dividend. This
dividend will remain constant. If the public’s required rate of return for Berklee stock is 8%, at what price
should this company’s stock sell?
2.Donna enters into an investment contract that will guarantee her 4% per year if she deposits $3,500 each
year for the next 10 years. She must make the first deposit one year from today, the day she signs the
agreement. How much will she have when she makes her last payment 10 years from now?
3.Assume the same facts as in problem 2 above, except that Donna negotiates the chance to make her first
payment now and continue to pay at the beginning of each year for the 10-year period. How much will she
have accumulated?
4.Bill will receive a royalty payment of $18,000 per year for the next 25 years, beginning one year from now,
as a result of a book he has written. If a discount rate of 10 percent is applied, should he be willing to sell
out his future rights now for $160,000? How about $162,500? $165,000?
5.Debbie won the $60 million lottery. She is to receive $1 million a year for the next 50 years beginning one
year from now, plus an additional lump sum payment of $10 million after 50 years. The discount rate is 10
percent. How much cash would she need to be offered today to tempt her to take a lump-sum cash offer
instead, all things equal?
6.Kim started a paper route on January 1, 2016. Every three months, she deposited $300 in her new bank
account, which earned 4 percent annually but was compounded quarterly. On December 31, 2019, she
placed the entire balance in her bank account in an investment that earned 5 percent annually. How much
will she have on December 31, 2022?
7.You hire Thomas to work for you for five years, and you agree to put away enough money as a lump sum
now to fund an annuity for him. At the end of those five years, he will retire and may begin drawing out
$20,000 per year for five years, starting on the last day of each year (in this case, the end of year 6, from
when this arrangement began, through year 10). How much must you invest today if your guaranteed
interest rate is 3% compounded annually for all 10 years?
8.Your new boss doesn’t have a pension or 401(k) plan for your retirement, but she agrees to place aside
$12,000 every year once a year for four years. She gives you the option of either starting immediately on
your first day of work or starting one year from now. That makes this the difference between an ordinary
annuity and an annuity due. If the plan earns 5% per year, compounded annually, what will be the
difference between the two approaches after the four years / four payments?
9.Jada is borrowing $40,000 from you today. She agrees to pay you back in annual installments beginning a
year from now over eight years, with interest at 3%. What would her annual payment amount be, including
both interest and principal?

Why It Matters
Baseball legend TedWilliamsonce said, “Baseball is the only field of endeavor where a man can succeed three
times out of ten and be considered a good performer.”

On routine or unimportant decisions, business
managers might aspire to do as well as Ted Williams, making the right decisions only 30% of the time. But a
professional decision maker must “hit it out of the park” when making major capital investment choices and
recommendations.
As a student in a course of business studies and career development, it is highly likely that you will be a
decision maker about projects that are likely to generate future cash flows but will also require a large initial
expense. When you ask your manager to invest $500,000 or more in a new piece of equipment that could help
your department meet or exceed its goals, you must be prepared to defend your request. Competing
managers and departments will be asking for similar funding, and there simply might not be enough for
everyone. This decision process requires financial analysis.
MarkCubanofShark Tankfame enjoys citing the series’ catchphrase: “Know thy numbers.” As a business
professional, you must be able to assess potential profit against expenditures to be successful. In most cases,
this is based on our understanding ofcash flow. A major capital investment might seem initially like a gamble,
but it is a gamble that can be hedged in your favor with understanding, analysis, and knowledge of your
numbers.
The purpose of this chapter is to give you information and instruction on how this is done. The techniques we
will discuss in this chapter will clarify decisions that must be made in the process of investing in a business. We

focus first on decisions we make about our own money as investors if uneven cash receipts or payments are
involved.
9.1Timing of Cash Flows
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Describe how multiple payments of unequal value are present in everyday situations.
•Calculate the future value of a series of multiple payments of unequal value.
•Calculate the present value of a series of multiple payments of unequal value.
Multiple Payments or Receipts of Unequal Value: The Mixed Stream
At this point, you are familiar with the time value of money of single amounts and annuities and how they
must be managed and controlled for business as well as personal purposes. If a stream of payments occurs in
which the amount of the payments changes at any point, the techniques for solving for annuities must be
modified. Shortcuts that we have seen in earlier chapters cannot be taken. Fortunately, with tools such as
financial or online calculators and MicrosoftExcel, the method can be quite simple.
The ability to analyze and understandcash flowis essential. From a personal point of view, assume that you
have an opportunity to invest $2,000 every year, beginning next year, to save for a down payment on the
purchase of your first home seven years from now. In the third year, you also inherit $10,000 and put it all
toward this goal. In the fifth year, you receive a large bonus of $3,000 and also dedicate this to your ongoing
investment.
The stream of regular payments has been interrupted—which is, of course, good news for you. However, it
does add a new complexity to the math involved in finding values related to time, whether compounding into
the future or discounting to the present value. Analysts refer to such a series of payments as amixed stream.
If you make the first payment on the first day of next year and continue to do so on the first day of each
following year, and if your investment will always be earning 7% interest, how much cash will you have
accumulated—principal plus earned interest—at the end of the seven years?
This is a future value question, but because the stream of payments is mixed, we cannot use annuity formulas
or approaches and the shortcuts they provide. As noted in previous chapters, when solving a problem
involving the time value of money, a timeline and/or table is helpful. The cash flows described above are
shown inTable 9.1. Remember that all money is assumed to be deposited in your investment at the beginning
of each year. The cumulative cash flows do not yet consider interest.

Cash Invested$0.00$2,000$2,000$2,000$12,000$2,000$5,000$2,000
Cumulative Cash Flows$2,000$4,000$6,000$18,000$20,000$25,000$27,000
Table9.1
By the end of seven years, you have invested $27,000 of your own money before we consider interest:
•Seven years times $2,000 each year, or $14,000
•The extra $10,000 you received in year 3 (which is invested at the start of year 4)
•The extra $3,000 you received in year 5 (which is invested at the start of year 6)
These funds were invested at different times, and time and interest rate will work for you on all accumulated
balances as you proceed. Therefore, focus on the line in your table with the cumulative cash flows. How much
cash will you have accumulated at the end of this investment program if you’re earning 7% compounded

annually? You could use thefuture value of a single amountequation, but not for an annuity. Because the
amount invested changes, you must calculate the future value of each amount invested and add them
together for your result.
Recall that the formula for finding the future value of a single amount is, where FV is the
future value we are trying to determine, PV is the value invested at the start of each period,iis the interest
rate, andnis the number of periods remaining for compounding to take effect.
Let us repeat the table with your cash flows above.Table 9.2includes a line to show for how many periods
(years, in this case) each investment will compound at 7%.

Years to Compound7654321
Table9.2
The $2,000 that you deposit at the start of year 1 will earn 7% interest for the entire seven years. When you
make your second investment at the start of year 2, you will now have spent $4,000. However, the interest
from your first $2,000 investment will have earned you, so you will begin year 2 with
$4,140 rather than $4,000.
Before we complicate the problem with a schedule that ties everything together, let’s focus on years 1 and 2
with the original formula for the future value of a single amount. What will your year 1 investment be worth at
the end of seven years?
You need to address the year 2 investment separately at this point because you’ve calculated the year 1
investment and its compounding on its own. Now you need to know what your year 2 investment will be worth
in the future, but it will only compound for six years. What will it be worth?
You can perform the same operation on each of the remaining five invested amounts, remembering that you
invest $12,000 at the start of year 4 and $5,000 at the start of year 6, as per the table. Here are the five
remaining calculations:
Notice how the exponent representingndecreases each year to reflect the decreasing number of years that
each invested amount will compound until the end of your seven-year stream. For clarity, let us insert each of
these amounts in a row ofTable 9.3:

Table9.3
The solution to the original question—the value of your seven different investments at the end of the seven-
year period—is the total of each individual investment compounded over the remaining years. Adding the
compounded values in the bottom row provides the answer: $35,062.26. This includes the $27,000 that you
invested plus $8,062.26 in interest earned by compounding.
It’s important to note that throughout these sections on the time value of money and compounded or
discounted values of mixed streams and their analysis, we are placing the valuation at the end or beginning of
a period for simplicity in the examples. In reality, businesses might consider valuations happening within the
period to allow for a degree of regularity in the revenue streams provided by the asset being considered.
However, because this is a technique of forecasting, which is inherently uncertain, we will continue with
analysis by period.

Future Value of a Mixed Stream
Assume that you can invest five annual payments of $10,000, beginning immediately, but you believe you
will be able to invest additional amounts of $5,000 at the beginning of years 4 and 5. This investment is
expected to earn 4% each year. What is the anticipated future value of this investment after the full five
years?

Let’s take the example above and review it from a different angle. Keeping in mind that we have not yet
explored the use of Excel, is there another way to view our solution? The problem above takes each annual
investment and compounds it into the future, then adds the results of each calculation to find the total future
value of the stream of payments.
But when you break the problem down, another way to look at the problem is as a five-year annuity of $10,000
per yearplusadded payments in years 4 and 5. Can we solve for the future value of an annuity first and then
perform two separate calculations on the additional amounts ($5,000 each in years 4 and 5)? Yes, we can.
Let’s summarize:
•Future value of a $10,000 annuity due, 4%, 5 years,plus
•Future value of a single payment of $5,000, 4%, 2 years,plus
•Future value of a single payment of $5,000, 4%, 1 year
This must give us the same result. The formula for the future value of an annuity due is
This problem can be solved in the three steps of the summary above.
Step 1:
Step 2:
Step 3:
Combining the results from each of the three steps gives us
It works. Whether you view this problem as five separate periods that can be compounded separately and
then combined or as a combination of one or more annuities and/or single payment problems, we always
arrive at the same solution if we are diligent about the time, the interest, and the stream of payments.
The Present Value of a Mixed Stream
Now that we’ve seen the calculation of afuture value, consider apresent value. We will begin with a
personal example. You win a cash windfall through your state’s lottery. You would like to take a portion of the
funds and place them in a fixed investment so that you can draw $17,000 per year starting one year from now
and continue to do so for the next two years. At the end of year 4, you want to withdraw $17,500, and at the
end of year 5, you will withdraw the last $18,000 to close the account. When you take your last payment of
$18,000, your fund will be totally depleted. You will always be earning 6% annually. How much of your cash
windfall should you set aside today to accomplish this?
Let us break down the problem, remembering that we are thinking in reverse from the earlier problems that
involved future values. In this case, we’re bringing future values back in time to find their present values. You
will recall that this process is calleddiscountingrather thancompounding.
Regardless of how we solve this, the question remains the same: How much money must we invest today
(present value) to achieve this? And remember that we will always be earning 6% compounded annually on
any invested balances.
9.1 • Timing of Cash Flows267

We are calculating present values as we did in previous chapters, given a known future value “target,” in order
to determine how much money you need today to achieve that goal. Let us break this down by first reviewing
the relevant equations from previous chapters.
Present value of an ordinary annuity:
Present value of a single amount:
where PVa is the present value of an annuity, PYMT is one payment in a consistent stream (an annuity),iis the
interest rate (annual unless otherwise specified),nis the number of periods, PV is the present value of a single
amount, and FV is the future value of a single amount.
You want to find out how much money you need to set aside today to accomplish your goal. You can also find
out how much money you need to set aside in each period to accomplish this goal. Therefore, we can address
this problem in increments. Let us look at potential solutions.
First, we will break this down into the cash flows of each year.Table 9.5shows the timing of the future cash
flows you’re expecting:
Year012345
Expected Amount to Be Withdrawn at End of Year$0.00$17,000$17,000$17,000$17,500$18,000
Table9.5
One method is to take each year’s cash flows, which happen at the end of the year, and discount them to
today using the present value formula for a single amount:
Because year 1’s withdrawal from your fund only has one year to earn interest, we discounted it for one year.
The second amount is discounted for two years:
The next three years are discounted in the same way, for three, four, and five years, respectively:
Notice how we reverse our thinking on the exponentnfrom our approach to future value. This time, it
increases each period because we discount each future amount for a longer period to arrive at the value in
today’s dollars.
When we add all five discounted present value amounts from above, we derive today’s value of $72,753.49.
Expressed more simply, if you wanted to extract the specified stream of cash flows at the end of each year
2689 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values
Access for free at openstax.org

($17,000 for three years, then $17,500, then $18,000), you would have to begin with $72,753.49. The thing to
remember is that any amounts remaining in this fund, regardless of how you deplete it, will always be earning
6% annually. SeeTable 9.6.
Year012345
Withdrawn at End of Year$17,000.00$17,000.00$17,000.00$17,500.00$18,000.00
Interest on Balance$4,365.21$3,607.12$2,803.55$1,951.76$1,018.87
Remaining Balance$72,753.49$60,118.70$46,725.82$32,529.37$16,981.13$0.00
Table9.6
Let us try another approach. Because the amount of cash withdrawn in the first three years remains constant
at $17,000, it can be viewed as an annuity—specifically, a three-period annuity of $17,000 and two single
payments of $17,500 and $18,000. Therefore, we could also discount (bring to present value) an annuity of
$17,000 for three years (the first three) and then combine it with the year 4 discounted amount and the year 5
discounted amount. We can try it using the formulas for PVa and PVused above. In Step 1, we will discount the
first three years as an annuity (ordinary, as the first withdrawal is not made until one year from now); in Step 2,
we will discount the year 4 single payment amount; and in Step 3, we will do the same for the year 5 single
payment amount. Then we can add them together.
Step 1: Find the present value of the annuity using the PVa formula:
Step 2: Discount the year 4 amount using the formula for the present value of a single amount:
Step 3: Perform the same operation as in Step 2 for the year 5 amount:
Now that all three amounts have been discounted to today’s value, we can add them:
Calculating the present value of cash flows is very common and critical in the analysis ofcapital investments
in business for two compelling reasons: first, the investment is likely quite significant, and second, the risk will
usually encompass a longer time frame. When the author of this chapter would purchase a large machine, it
would likely take several years for that machine to justify its purchase with the revenues it would generate.
This is one of the primary reasons that accountants require us to depreciate the cost of an asset over time: to
assess the cost against the time it will take for that asset to produce profits and cash flow.
9.1 • Timing of Cash Flows269

THINK IT THROUGH
Present Value of a Mixed Stream
Assume that you decide to invest $450,000. All cash flows are discounted at 4%. You are told by your
financial advisor to expect cash inflows from your investment of $100,000 in year 1, $125,000 in year 2,
$175,000 in year 3, $90,000 in year 4, and $50,000 in year 5. Would you agree to this plan based only on the
numbers? Each amount will be withdrawn at the end of every year, and interest will be compounded
annually.
Solution:
Year012345
Expected Amount to Be Withdrawn at End of Year$0.00$100,000$125,000$175,000$90,000$50,000
Table9.7
Applying the formula for the present value of a single amount, we discount each amount and then add the
discounted amounts. We will simplify this approach with Excel shortly, but we must understand the
reasoning behind discounting uneven cash flow streams with a direct solution.
By combining the five discounted amounts above, we get a total present value of $485,326.48. This amount
represents the value today of the five expected cash inflows for as long as our remaining balance is earning
4%.
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Thoughts on Cash Flow from Irina Simmons
In 2013, the author interviewed IrinaSimmons, senior vice president, chief risk officer, and former treasurer
ofEMC Corporation. The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,
and several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.
AA:Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it
compare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?
Simmons:While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an
organization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a
transparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash
flow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and
success.

AA:In your bio, you mention liquidity management. Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity
management is so important to a firm?
Simmons:Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for
liquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then
based on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions. A disciplined
approach to projecting one’s cash position means that instead of investing cash in the money market to
maximize day-to-day liquidity, you can look into longer-term investments that can provide a significantly
higher return. This is essential to the effective matching of cash inflows and outflows for the firm.
AA:In summary, do you have any words of advice to students who might have an eye to entrepreneurial

Simmons:“Cash is king,” don’t forget that. Understand how cash moves through a business. It is also very
important to implement and retain a cash management discipline. Never put that off until later. Many
times, start-ups will say, “Well, I have all this venture money, and we can start making things happen and
worry about being good cash managers later.” But what I’ve seen is that the longer companies wait, the
harder it is to break bad habits. Making cash management a priority now will serve entrepreneurs in perfect
stead as their business starts to gain traction.
We closed this excellent interview with agreement that we were “kindred spirits” regarding the importance
of cash flow analysis, including capital decisions such as those mentioned in this chapter. We confirmed
with each other the core belief that “cash flow is the axis upon which the world of business spins.”

9.2Unequal Payments Using a Financial Calculator or Microsoft Excel
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate unequal payments using a financial calculator.
•Calculate unequal payments using Microsoft Excel.
Using a Financial Calculator
A financial calculator provides utilities to simplify the analysis of uneven mixed cash streams (seeTable 9.8).
Earlier, we explored the future value of a seven-year mixed stream, with $2,000 being saved each year, plus an
additional $10,000 in year 4 and an additional $3,000 in year 6. All cash flows and balances earn 7% per year
compounded annually, and the payments are made at the start of each year. We proved that this result totals
approximately $35,062.26. We begin by clearing all memory functions and then entering each cash flow as
follows:

At this point, we have found the net present value of this uneven stream of payments. You will recall, however,
that we are not trying to calculate present values; we are looking for future values. The TI BA II Plus™
Professional calculator does not have a similar function for future value. This means that either we can find the
future value for each payment in the stream and combine them, or we can take the net present value we just
calculated and easily project it forward using the following keystrokes. Note the net present value solution in
Step 20 above. We will use that and then use the simpler of the two approaches to calculate future value (see

This is consistent with the solution we found earlier, with a difference of one cent due to rounding error.
We may also use the calculator to solve for the present value of a mixed cash stream. Earlier in this chapter, we
asked how much money you would need today to fund the following five annual withdrawals, with each
withdrawal made at the end of the year, beginning one year from now, and all remaining money earning 6%
compounded annually:

We determined these withdrawals to have a total present value of $72,753.30. Here is an approach to a
solution using a financial calculator. In this example, we will store all cash flows in the calculator and perform
an operation on them as a whole (seeTable 9.11). Because we will use the NPV function (to be explored in
more detail in a later chapter), we enter our starting point as 0 because we do not withdraw any cash until one
year after we begin.

Using Microsoft Excel
Several of the exhibits already in this chapter have been prepared with Microsoft Excel. While full mastery of
Excelrequires extensive study and practice, enough basics can be learned in two or three hours to provide the
user with the ability to quickly and conveniently solve problems, including extensive financial applications.
Potential employers and internship hosts have come to expect basic Excel knowledge, something to which you
9.2 • Unequal Payments Using a Financial Calculator or Microsoft Excel273

are exposed in college.
We will demonstrate the same two problems using Excel rather than a calculator:
1.The future value of a mixed cash stream for a seven-year investment
2.The present value of a mixed cash stream of five withdrawals that you wish to make from a fund to be
established today
Beginning with the future value problem, we created a simple matrix to lay out the mixed stream of future
cash flows, starting on the first day of each year, with all funds earning 7% throughout. Our goal is to
determine how much money you will have saved at the end of this seven-year period.
Table 9.12repeats the data from earlier in the chaper for your convenience.

9 Excel exhibits.
We begin by entering the cash flow as shown inFigure 9.2. The assumed interest rate is 7%. The interest on
the balance is calculated as the amount invested at the start of the year multiplied by the assumed interest
rate. The cumulative cash flows of each year are calculated as follows: for year 1, the amount invested plus the
interest on the balance; for years 2 through 7, the amount invested plus the interest on the balance plus the
previous year’s running balance. By adding up the amount invested and the interest on the balance, you
should arrive at a total of $35,062.27.
We can use Excel formulas to solve time value of money problems. For example, if we wanted to find the
present value of the amount invested at 7% over the seven-year time period, we could use the NPV function in
Excel. The dialog box for this function (Rate, Value 1, Value2) is shown inFigure 9.3.

Summary
9.1Timing of Cash Flows
To understand the true value and strength of cash, it is necessary to consider its timing. This is relevant for
investments for the future and for analyses of the value of projects that require investment today to produce
expected flows of cash later. These future cash flows could involve inflows or outflows of cash in unequal
amounts. This section analyzed the determination of present and future value of these uneven or mixed cash
flows.
9.2Unequal Payments Using a Financial Calculator or Microsoft Excel
This section discussed the use of two tools for managing and understanding the time value of money and its
many applications when the flows of cash are unequal: the TI BA II Plus™ Professional financial calculator and
the spreadsheet application Excel.

Problems
1.Your aunt promises to gift you $1,500 now, $1,700 one year from now, $1,900 two years from now, and
$2,500 three years from now. You will deposit all four amounts in an account that bears 3% interest
compounded annually. How much will be in the account at the end of the fourth year?
2.You believe that you can set aside $1,200 each year for the next four years, starting immediately, in order
to buy a small fishing boat for your retirement. Your friend Luis promises that he’ll pay you back $4,900
that he owes you three years from now, so you will add that to the payment you make at the start of year
4. Then, at the start of year 5, you will increase your payment to $1,400; in year 6, to $1,500; and in year 7,
to $1,600. Every payment will be deposited in a fund bearing 4% interest compounded annually. How
much will you have set aside for your boat at the end of the seventh year?
3.Assume you win a lottery that will pay you $10,000 immediately, plus $20,000 one year from now, $30,000
two years from now, $40,000 three years from now, and $75,000 four years from now. You’re curious
about how much the lottery commission might offer you as an immediate lump sum instead. What is the
minimum amount you should consider accepting today instead? Use a 5% annual discount rate. Please
remember that we are ignoring taxation and other considerations and basing this only on the math itself.
4.Assume you win a lottery, and you are offered the following stream of payments by the lottery
commission: $25,000 today, $32,000 one year from now, another $32,000 two years from now, and a final
payment of $55,000 three years from now. You accept the offer. If you invest all of these proceeds at 6%
compounded annually and extract nothing from the investment, how much will you have at the end of the
fourth year?
5.You are offered a business partnership that guarantees you cash returns of $150,000 one year from now,
nothing at the end of year 2, and $350,000 at the end of year 3. After year 3, the partnership will be
dissolved, and there will be no more expected returns on your investment. If you analyze this plan
expecting 7% compounded annually, what is this potential deal worth to you today?
6.Tony owns a small business that he is attempting to sell. A potential buyer offers him $500,000 today, plus
$1,500,000 two years from now and a balance of $1,700,000 three years from now. Tony always analyzes
cash flows using a rate of 4% compounded annually. To compare this to other offers, which would be paid
in cash immediately, he wants to know the present value of these future cash flows. Show the calculation
and solution that you would present to Tony to use in his decision.
7.Continuing Problem 6 above, assume that as Tony receives each payment from the buyer, he can
immediately invest it in a fund that returns a guaranteed 3.5% compounded annually. If he accepts the
terms of this offer, how much will he have accumulated in this investment four years from now?
8.You hire Susan for a three-year term. She has no retirement plan, so you agree to invest money
immediately to allow her a stream of three payments beginning one year after her employment term
ends. Draw a timeline! The money you invest for the full six years of this arrangement (three years of
employment and three years of withdrawals) always earns 4% compounded annually. When Susan
receives her third and last payment, the fund will be depleted and equal zero. The three payments she will
receive are as follows:
End of year 4: $25,000
End of year 5: $30,000
End of year 6: $37,000
Therefore, your goal is to have enough money in this account at the end of Susan’s three-year
employment term to assure her of receiving these payments.
How much money must you invest today to accomplish this strategy?

Why It Matters
When an investor purchases a bond, that person is, for all intents and purposes, making a loan to the bond
issuer. Bonds issues are used to raise funds and can be issued by corporations, governments, or even
subagencies of governments (including local municipalities).
As with any type of loan, the borrowing party is expected to offer something to the lender in exchange for
their time and trouble. In this case, the bond-issuing entity will agree not only to repay the original face value
of the loan on a specific date (the maturity of the bond) but also to pay the lender interest—or, in bond
terminology, coupon payments.
Coupon payments are designed to make a bond purchase more acceptable for investors by helping
compensate them for the time value of money. Because investors are parting with money that they have right
now in order to make the initial bond purchase but will not see repayment of principal until the maturity date
of the bond, they will experience the negative impact of time value over the bond term. When a bond issuer
offers periodic coupon payments, this helps offset the negative effect of the delayed receipt of the principal
amount for the investor. Also, because coupon payments will be coming to the investor throughout the term
of the bond, essentially in installment payments (an annuity), the time value of money plays a critical role in
bond transactions and in calculating bond valuation.
Bonds, along with stocks and mutual funds, are considered to be one of the most basic financial instruments
available to any investor. It is quite common for investors to round out their portfolios by purchasing bonds,

10.1Characteristics of Bonds
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•List and define the basic characteristics of bonds.
•List and describe the various types of bonds available.
•Explain how a bond price is inversely related to its return (yield).
Bonds as Investments
One way to look at bond investments is to consider the fact that any investor who purchases a bond is
essentially buying a future cash flow stream that the bond issuer (or borrower) promises to make as per
agreement.
Because bonds provide a set amount of cash inflow to their owners, they are often called fixed-income
securities. Thus, future cash flows from the bond are clearly stated per agreement and fixed when the bond
sale is completed.
Bonds are a basic form of investment that typically include a straightforward financial agreement between
issuer and purchaser. Nevertheless, the terminology surrounding bonds is unique and rather extensive. Much
of the specialized vocabulary surrounding bonds is designed to convey the concept that a bond is similar to
other financial instruments in that it is an investment that can be bought and sold. Much of this unique
terminology will be covered later in this chapter, but we can set out some of the basics here with an example.
Let’s say that you buy a $1,000 bond that was issued by Apple Inc. at 5% interest, paid annually, for 20 years.
Here, you are the lender, and Apple Inc. is the borrower.

Informational Basics on Bonds
This video(https://openstax.org/r/the-basics-of-bonds)fromMoneyWeekeditor TimBennettprovides
information about the basics of bonds—what they are, how they work, why companies and governments
issue them, and why investors might buy them.
Basic Terminology
We need to know the following basic bond terms and pricing in order to apply the necessary time value of
money equation to value thisApple, Inc.bond issue:
•Par value: A bond will always clearly state its par value, also called face amount or face value. This is equal
to the principal amount that the issuer will repay at the end of the bond term or maturity date. In our
example, the par value of the bond is $1,000.
•Coupon rate: This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon payments, on
the bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon
payments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments
other than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the
entire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.
•Coupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic
interest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is
important to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest
28410 • Bonds and Bond Valuation

annually. However, if a bond pays interest on a semiannual or quarterly basis, the coupon rate will have to
be divided by 2 or 4, respectively, to convert the stated annual rate to the correct periodic rate. In our
example, coupons are paid annually, so the periodic or annual interest that is paid is equal to
. You may notice that because these payments are the same amount and made at
regular intervals, they constitute an annuity stream (refer toTime Value of Money II: Equal Multiple
Payments.
•Maturity date: The maturity date is the expiration date of the bond, or the point in time when the term of
a bond comes to an end. On the maturity date, the issuer will make the final interest or coupon payment
on the bond and will also pay off its principal, or face value. In our example, the maturity date is at the end
of the 20-year period.
•Yield to maturity (YTM): The YTM is essentially the discount rate used to bring the future cash flows of a
bond into present value terms. It also equals the return that the investor will receive if the bond is held to
maturity. The YTM helps quantify the overall investment value of a bond. We will explore how to compute
this rate later in the chapter.

Types of Bonds
There are three primary categories of bonds, though the specifics of these different types of bond can vary
depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest rate, and risk.
Government Bonds
The safest category of bonds are short-termUS Treasury bills (T-bills). These investments are considered safe
because they have the full backing of the US government and the likelihood ofdefault(nonpayment) is
remote. However, T-bills also pay the least interest due to their safety and the economics of risk and return,
which state that investors must be compensated for the assumption of risk. As risk increases, so should return
on investment. Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10
years, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date
of issue.
Savings bondsare debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.
Essentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a
guaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the
future. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the
buyer losing their investment. For this reason, the return on savings bonds is relatively low compared to other
forms of bonds and investments.
LINK TO LEARNING
Government Bonds
Review thisintroductory video(https://openstax.org/r/treasury-bonds-prices)about government bonds.
Municipal bonds (“munis”)are issued by cities, states, and localities or their agencies. Munis typically will
return a little more than Treasury bills while being just a bit riskier.
Corporate Bonds
Corporate bonds are issued by companies. They carry more risk than government bonds because corporations
can’t raise taxes to pay for their bond issues. The risk and return of a corporate bond will depend on how
creditworthy the company is. The highest-paying and highest-risk corporate bonds are often referred to as
non-investment grade or, more commonly,junk bonds.
Corporate bonds that do not make regular coupon payments to their owners are referred to aszero-coupon
bonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount from their par values and will repay the full par value at
their maturity date. The difference between what the investor spends on them in original purchase price and
the par value paid at maturity will represent the investor’s total dollar value return.
Convertible bondsare similar to other types of corporate bonds but have a feature that allows for their
conversion into a predetermined number of common stock shares. The conversion from the bond to stock can
be done at certain times during the bond’s life, usually at the discretion of the bondholder.

The Global Bond Market versus the Global Stock Market
Bonds have long been a trusted investment vehicle for many investors. Though the global fixed-income debt
market remains considerably larger than the global stock market, this is not an entirely fair comparison. Bond
markets include sovereign bonds, or bonds that are issues by governments, while stock markets do not. Some
experts believe that a more relevant comparison is between the value of corporate bond markets only
(excluding sovereign bonds) and total stock market value.
The chart inFigure 10.2provides global market value information by category so that we may make our own
conclusions about these markets.
Figure10.2Global Bonds versus Stocks: Total Market Values ($Trillions), November 2020(data source: Nasdaq)
While the total value of bond markets continues to exceed that of stocks, the prevailing trend over the past
several years has been that stock markets are gaining in terms of total market size. The primary reason for this
is that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods
of time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher
risk associated with stock.
The Two Sides of a Bond Investment
There are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash
inflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often
referred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also
calledinterest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly
indicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.
As a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money
techniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.
The Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates
Bond priceand interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice
versa (seeFigure 10.3). If interest rates increase, the value of bonds sold at lower interest rates will decline.
Similarly, if interest rates decline, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase. An exception to this general rule
isfloating-rate bonds(often referred to as “floaters,” floating-rate notes, or FRNs).
10.1 • Characteristics of Bonds287

Figure10.3The Seesaw Effect of Bond Prices and Interest Rates
A floating-rate note is a form of debt instrument that is similar to a standard fixed-rate bond but has a variable
interest rate. Rates for floating-rate bonds are typically tied to a benchmark interest rate that exists in the
economy. Common benchmark rates include theUS Treasury note rate, theFederal Reserve funds rate
(federal funds rate), theLondon Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and theprime rate.
So, investors who decide to purchase normal (fixed rate) bonds may not be thrilled to hear that the economy is
signaling inflation and that interest rates are forecasted to rise. These bond investors are aware that when
interest rates rise, their bond investments will lose value. This is not the case with floating- or variable-rate
bonds.
Bonds with very low coupon rates are referred to asdeep discount bonds. Of course, the bond that has the
greatest discount is the zero-coupon bond, with a coupon rate of zero. The smaller the coupon rate, the
greater the change in price when interest rates move.

Pricing a Bond in Steps
Why do we want to learn how to price a bond? The answer goes to the heart of finance: the valuation of
assets. We need to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. What is its value
to these interested parties? Remember that a bond is a financial asset that a company sells to raise money
from willing investors. Whether you are the company selling the bond or the investor buying the bond, you
want to make sure that you are selling or buying at the best available price.
Let’s begin our pricing examples with the3MCompany corporate bond listed inTable 10.1above. The table
28810 • Bonds and Bond Valuation
Access for free at openstax.org

information tells us that 3M issued a series of corporate bonds that promise to pay coupons annually on
September 19 and to pay back the principal, or face value, on the maturity date of September 19, 2026. While
this is not specified in the table, let’s say these are 15-year corporate bonds. In that case, we know that they
were issued on September 20, 2011.
The 3M bonds have an annual coupon rate of 2.25%, which indicates that the annual interest payment on the
bond will be the face value (assumed to be $1,000.00 multiplied by 2.25%), or $22.50. The appropriate discount
rate to apply to these future payments is the yield to bond maturity, 1.24%.
Note that the 3M bond is selling at a premium (above par or face value) due to the fact that its coupon rate is
greater than the YTM percentage. This means that the bond earns more value in interest than it loses due to
discounting its cash flows to allow for the time value of money principle.
Finally, the table tells us some of the bond’s features. For example, Standard & Poor’s, an international rating
agency, rates 3M Co. as A+ (high credit quality). Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning
that 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.
We can price a bond using the same methods from earlier chapters: an equation, a calculator, and a
spreadsheet. Let’s start with the equation method (seeFigure 10.4).
Figure10.4Steps in Pricing a Bond
The first step is to identify the amounts and the timing of the two types of future cash flows to be received on
the bond. Any bond that pays interest or coupon payments (coupon bonds) will have two sources of future
cash flow to its bondholder/investor: the periodic coupon payments, which are a form of annuity, and the final
lump sum payment of the face value amount at maturity.
As discussed above, the principal or face value is paid in a one-time lump sum payment at bond maturity. In
our example with 3M Co., this is the $1,000 par value of the bond that will be paid on the maturity date of
September 19, 2026. Step 1 is to lay out the timing and amount of the future cash flows. The first future cash
flow we need to determine is the annual interest payment. Here, it is the coupon rate of 2.25% times the par
value of the bond. As mentioned above, we will use $1,000 as the par value of this bond, so the annual coupon
or interest payment will equal $22.50:
The next future cash flow that we need to determine is the payment of the par value or principal—in this case,
the $1,000 par value of the bond—at the maturity date of September 19, 2026. We can set out the future cash
flows for the bond as shown inTable 10.2:

Principal$1,000
Table10.2
Note that annual coupon payments are made each year on September 19, and the first annual coupon
payment date is September 19, 2012. The annual payments continue for 15 years, with the last payment being
made on September 19, 2026. At this point, we can apply previously learned concepts: the coupon payments
constitute an annuity stream, or payments of the same amount at regular intervals.
The principal of $1,000 is also paid out at maturity. Here, we recognize another key concept: the final amount
is a lump sum payment. So, we now have the promised set of future cash flows for the 3M Co. bond.
In Step 2, we will need to decide on a discount rate to use on these future bond cash payments. For now, we
will jump to the answer and simply use the YTM of 1.24% from the bond data inTable 10.1. Later in the
chapter, we will develop the concepts behind how an appropriate discount rate is determined.
For Step 3, we now apply two equations to the set of future cash flows from the bond. This will then provide us
with the present values of these cash flows, or the expected present-day value of the bond. Because we know
that the coupon payments constitute an annuity stream, we can use the equation for the present value of an
annuity (discussed inTime Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments. To value the one-time par value
payment, we use the equation for the present value of a lump sum payment. So, by combining these, we will
have the present value of the coupon payment stream, or
So, for our example above, this becomes
Next, we need to determine the present value of the payment of the par or face value of the bond at maturity.
This is calculated as follows:
Inserting our values into this formula gives us
Adding the present values of the two payment streams gives us
Our bond price is $1,137.47. This bond price represents the value of the financial asset to both a willing buyer
and a willing seller.
In this example, the willing seller is 3M Company. The willing buyer is an investor who is demanding a 1.24%
yield on the investment. As perTable 10.1above, the 3M bond sold for $1,051.20 in March 2021. However, we

A financial calculator can also be used to solve common types of bond valuations. For example, what would be
the current price (value) of a 4% coupon bond, paid semiannually, with a face value of $1,000 and a remaining

Time Value Connection
As we have briefly discussed, bond valuation is determined by time value of money techniques, most notably
present value calculations. This makes logical sense when one considers that an investment in a bond involves
a series of future cash inflows, or payments from the bond issuer to the bondholder over the term of the
bond’s maturity.
To determine the value of a bond today, the two-step time value of money calculation we discussed earlier
must be used, and the present value of a series of coupon payments (or an annuity) must be determined. This
present value amount will then be added to the present value of a single lump sum payment (the principal or
face value) that will come to the bondholder at the end of the bond’s term (maturity).
Fixed Income
Because standard fixed-rate bonds have their coupon payments and maturity amounts locked in, they are
often referred to as fixed-income investments. This is because their values are relatively straightforward to
calculate. Bonds are generally viewed as stable investments that offer income and a lower amount of volatility
compared to stocks.

financial calculators for these types of calculations.

While yields provided by corporate and government bonds such as US T-bills and municipal bonds are
currently low because theFederal Reserve System (the Fed)has kept interest rates low for several years,
investors may still consider adding bonds to their portfolios.
2
This is especially true as investors enter their
retirement years and seek to generate income while avoiding the volatility of the stock market. Such investors
can add a mix of individual bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds to their portfolios, thus generating
potential return while keeping risks at a minimum. Fixed-income investments such as intermediate- or longer-
term bond funds are still providing good yields despite the low-interest-rate state of the economy.
It is important to note, however, that even though bonds are generally thought of as safer investments, they
still are subject to a number of risks. Because income from most bonds is fixed, such instruments can have
their values eroded by external factors such as interest rates and inflation. We will discuss some of these risks
after the next section.

Because the bond was issued on January 1, 2020, the year 2020 is the first full year of the bond, followed by the
years 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024, with the bond maturing in December of the latter year.
Cash inflows will be (1) the coupon or interest payments of, paid to the bondholder
every six months, and (2) the one-time principal or face-value payment of $100,000 upon maturity on
December 31, 2024.
Yields and Coupon Rates
The two interest rates that we associate with a bond are often confusing to students when they first begin to
work with bonds. The coupon rate is the interest rate printed on the bond; this is only used to determine the
interest or coupon payments. The yield to maturity (YTM) is an interest rate that is used to discount the bond’s
future cash flow. The YTM is derived from the marketplace and is based on the riskiness of future cash flows.
As we have seen when pricing bonds, a bond’s YTM is the rate of return that the bondholder will receive at the
current price if the investor holds the bond to maturity.
Yield to Maturity
As noted above, the market sets this discount rate, or the yield to maturity. The YTM reflects the going rate in
the bond market for this type of bond and the bond issuer’s perceived ability to make the future payments.
Hence, we base the yield on a mutually agreeable price between seller and buyer. The bond market
determines the YTM and the available supply of competing financial assets. By competing against other
available financial assets, the YTM reflects the risk-free rate and inflation, plus such premiums as maturity and
default specific to the issued bond.
The YTM is the expected return rate on the bond held to maturity. How do we determine the bond’s YTM? We
can use our same three trusty methods: equations, a financial calculator, and Microsoft Excel (as shown at the
end of the chapter).

Determining Bond Yield Using an Equation
The solution, when solving for discount rates, requires us to revisit the bond pricing formula, which is
Of course, with one equation, we can solve for only one unknown, and here the variable of concern isr, which
is the YTM. Unfortunately, it is difficult to isolateron the left-hand side of the equation. Therefore, we need to
use a calculator or spreadsheet to solve for the bond’s YTM.
Let’s take another bond, theCoca-Colabond, fromTable 10.1above and again back up our time to March

bond with a coupon rate of 1.0% and an original price of $952.06 at the time of issue (Table 10.5).

Determining Bond Yield Using a Calculator
For the Coca-Cola bond above, what was the bond’s YTM at its issue date? This is not an easy problem to solve
with a mathematical formula. It is far more practical, not to mention easier, to use a financial calculator or an
Excel spreadsheet to solve for bond prices, yields, and maturity periods.
We will cover Excel applications later, but we can jump into some calculator examples right now. So, to
calculate the yield on the Coca-Cola bond, we’ll start by entering the values we have for this bond into a
calculator. The values we know are as follows:
If the bond’s selling price was $952.06 at issue, we have all the information we need to determine the bond’s

Table10.6Calculator Steps for Bond’s Yield to Maturity at Issue
The calculated I/Y (interest rate or YTM) of 0.8651 is a semiannual figure because the periods and coupon
payments we entered for the calculation are semiannual values. To covert the semiannual value into an annual
rate, we will need multiply the calculated I/Y by 2. This gives us an amount of 1.73%.
So, the YTM of the Coca-Cola bond at issue date was 1.73%. It is important to know that unless otherwise
indicated, bond yields are expressed in annual percentage terms.
We have just demonstrated how a calculator can be used to determine the YTM or interest rate of a bond.
Let’s look at a few more examples that cover the most common types of bond problems. These are
determining a YTM, calculating a bond’s current price (or value), and determining a bond’s maturity period.
First, let’s work through another example of calculating a YTM, but this time with a bond that has annual
interest payments instead of semiannual coupons.
Let’s say you are considering buying a bond, but you want to calculate the YTM to determine if it will meet
your overall return requirements. Some facts you have on the bond are that it has a $1,000 face value and that
it matures in 12 years. Assume that the current price of the bond is $675 and it pays coupons annually at 3.5%.

Table10.10Calculator Steps for Computing Coupon Payment
Solution:
The annual coupon payment amount is $28.24. This means the coupon rate on the bond is.
The Coupon Rate
The coupon rate is the rate that we use to determine the amount of a bond’s coupon payments. The issuer
states the rate as an annual rate, even though payments may be made more frequently. Thus, for semiannual
bonds, the most common type of corporate and government bond, the coupon payment is the par value of the
bond multiplied by the annual coupon rate and then divided by the number of payments per year, 2.
We have already seen the coupon rate. The first bond we reviewed, the 3M Co. bond, was an annual coupon
bond with a coupon rate of 2.25%. Using a par value of $1,000, we determined that the annual coupon
payments would be.
For the Coca-Cola bond, we note fromTable 10.5that it has a coupon rate of 1% and is paid semiannually.
Using a par value of $1,000, we can determine that the coupon payments would be.
The Relationship of Yield to Maturity and Coupon Rate to Bond Prices
The value or price of any bond has a direct relationship with the YTM and the coupon rate.
•When the coupon rate of a bond exceeds the YTM, the bond sells at a premium compared to its par value.
That is, market demand will push the price of the bond to an amount greater that than its face or par
value. We call this kind of bond apremium bond.
•When the coupon rate is less than the YTM, the bond sells at a discounted amount, or less than its par
value. We refer to such a bond as adiscount bond.
•When the coupon rate and YTM are identical, a bond will sell at its par value. Bonds that experience this
scenario in the market are referred to as par value bonds.
The interest or coupon payments of a bond are determined by its coupon rate and are calculated by
multiplying the face value of the bond by this coupon rate.
The inverse relationship of interest rates and bond prices is an important concept for investors to know.
Because interest rates fluctuate and can change significantly over time, it is important to understand how
these changes will impact bond values.

Term Structure of Interest Rates
The expected yields of various bonds across different maturity periods are referred to as theterm structure of
interest rates. This is because they represent interest rates for different periods of time, maturities, or terms.
When interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are
connected, the resulting line is called ayield curve. Essentially, the yield curve is a result of this plotting
process and becomes a graphical representation of the term structure of interest rates. A yield curve will
always be constructed by showing the value of yields (rates) on they-axis and maturities or time periods on
thex-axis (seeFigure 10.5).
To create a useful graph of the yield curve, interest rate yields should be computed for all government bonds
at all remaining times to maturity. For example, the yields on all government bonds with a single year
remaining until maturity should be calculated. This value is then plotted on they-axis against the one-year
term on thex-axis. Similarly, yields on government bonds with two years remaining until maturity are
calculated and plotted on they-axis against two years on thex-axis, and so on, until a point of critical mass of
information is reached and the resulting graph displays useful information.
The yield curve for government bonds is also known as therisk-free yield curvebecause these securities are
thought of as safe investments that are not expected to fail or default and will in all likelihood repay or
otherwise meet all financial obligations made through the bond issuance.
Figure10.5A Normal Yield Curve: Long-Term Rates Are Higher Than Short-Term Rates
A normal yield curve slopes upward, with yield increasing as the term increases. This is because yields on
fixed-income investments such as bonds will rise as maturity periods increase and produce greater levels of
risk.
Corporate issuers of bonds will usually offer bond issues at higher yields that the government, which is
understandable because they are potentially riskier for investors. Government securities are guaranteed by
governments and have little to no chance of default or nonpayment. This is not the case for corporate bonds,
where there is always a chance of default, though the likelihood of this occurring will vary by individual
company or issuer as well as by bond type and term. We will discuss bond default and default risk next.
LINK TO LEARNING
The Yield Curve
Reviewthis video(https://openstax.org/r/introduction-to-the-yield-curve)that introduces the concept of
the yield curve.
10.3 • Using the Yield Curve297

Different Shapes of the Yield Curve
There are two important elements to any yield curve that will define its shape: its level and its slope. The level
of a yield curve directly relates to the yield rates depicted on they-axis of the graph (seeFigure 10.6). The
slope of the yield curve indicates the difference between yields on short-term and longer-term investments.
The difference in yields is primarily due to investors’ expectations of the direction of interest rates in the
economy and how the federal funds rate (referred to ascash ratein many countries) is uncertain and may
differ significantly over time. As an example, yields on three-year bonds incorporate the expectations of
investors on how bank rates might move over the next three years, combined with the uncertainty of those
rates over the three-year period.
Figure10.6Changes in Yield Curve Depending on Cash Rate
As we briefly discussed above, a positive or normal yield curve is indicative of the investment community’s
requirements for higher rates of return as financial consideration for assuming the risk of entering into fixed-
income investments, such as the purchase of bond issues. Typically, as a bond term increases, so will the
potential interest rate risk to the bondholder. Therefore, bonds with longer terms will usually carry higher
coupon rates to make returns greater for investors. Additionally, economists have come to believe that a steep
positive yield curve is a sign that investors anticipate relatively high inflation in the future and thus higher
interest rates accompanied by higher investment yields over shorter (inflationary) periods of time.
Normal yield curves are generally observed during periods of economic expansion, when growth and inflation
are increasing. In any expansionary economy, there is a greater likelihood that future interest rates will be
higher than current rates. This tends to occur because investors will anticipate the Fed or the central bank
raising its short-term rates in response to higher inflation rates within the economy.
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
How COVID-19 Impacted the Yield Curve
Figure 10.7shows the relatively normal-shaped yield curve effective in February 2021.
29810 • Bonds and Bond Valuation
Access for free at openstax.org

Figure10.7Yield Curve in February 2021
A yield curve with an inverted (downward-sloping) shape is considered unusual and will occur when long-
term rates are lower than short-term rates. This causes the yield curve to assume an inverted shape with a
negative slope. An inverted yield curve has historically been observed as a prelude to a general decline in
economic activity and interest rate levels. In some countries, such as the United States, an inverted yield
curve has been associated with upcoming recession and economic contraction.
This may occur because central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, will often attempt
to stimulate a stagnant economy by reducing interest rates. Essentially, the potential actions of the central
bank to improve the economy have the effect of lowering overall money rates with the economy, which is
exactly what investors anticipated would happen and why the yield curve was inverted to begin with.
The yield curve was considered normal with an upward slope in August 2018, as shown inFigure 10.8, but
the curve inverted in March 2019 as yields on short-term bonds exceeded those of longer-term bonds,
resulting in concerns surrounding impending recession and other economic problems. This inverted shape
to the yield curve continued into 2020, as evidenced inFigure 10.9.
Figure10.8The Economy Shifts to an Inverted Yield Curve(data source: US Department of the Treasury, Resource Center,
Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates)
Yield curves constructed on different days in early 2020 appeared similar to the examples below. Again,
these are obviously not normal yield structures. As a specific example, note on the February 21, 2020, curve

that rates on five-year securities are lower than those of one-year and even three-month securities.
Figure10.9Elements of Inversion in Recent Yield Curves(data source: US Department of the Treasury, Resource Center, Daily
Treasury Yield Curve Rates)
This inverted yield curve signaled the beginning of a recessionary period in the United States, which was
compounded by theCOVID-19pandemic and the closing of many restaurants and businesses.
In March and April 2020, the US economy experienced a significant decline. Most economic indicators
dropped so badly that the National Bureau of Economic Research’sBusiness Cycle Dating Committee, the
US agency that officially declares recessions, was required to intervene.
3
The recession declaration process by the committee is completed over the course of four months, but in
this instance, it only took a total of 15 weeks for the committee to make its declaration. This remains the
fastest declaration by the committee on record since the founding of the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER) in 1978.
4
In July 2021, the committee declared that the economy had reached a trough in April 2020, marking the end
of the recession of the early 2020s and making it the shortest US recession on record as well as the most
quickly identified one.

A flat shape for the yield curve occurs when there is not a great deal of difference between short-term and
long-term yields (seeFigure 10.10). A flat curve is usually not long lasting and is often observed when the
curve is transitioning between a normal and an inverted shape, or vice versa.
A flat yield curve has also been observed as a result of low interest rate levels or some types of unconventional
monetary policy.

Why Is the Yield Curve Important?
Market technicians, brokers, and investment analysts will study the yield curve in great detail by keeping track
of its many changes and movements. This is because of the overall importance of the yield curve as an
economic indicator and how it can be representative of the ideas, attitudes, and bond market expectations of
individuals as well as large institutional investors that exert significant influence on investment markets and
the economy as a whole.
10.4Risks of Interest Rates and Default
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define interest rate, default, and other common forms of bond risk.
•Calculate the primary indicator of interest raterisk.
•Determine factors impacting default risk.
•Understand bond laddering as an investment strategy.
•List major rating agencies and their indications of default.
•Define and calculate the yield to maturity (YTM) on a bond.
Bond Risks
As we touched on earlier, bonds are fixed-income investments, and because of this, they are subject to a
number of risks that could have negative effects on their market value. The most common and best-known
risks areinterest rate riskanddefault risk, but other risks exist that should be understood. Among these
risks are the following:
•Credit risk. If investors believe that a bond issuer is unlikely to meet its payment commitments, they may
demand a higher yield to purchase the bond issue in the first place. Due to the relative stability of
governments compared to corporations, government bonds are considered to have low credit risk.
•Liquidity risk. If investors believe that a bond may be difficult to sell, it will likely have a higher yield. This
has the effect of compensating the bondholder for the lack of liquidity (the ability to cash out of the bond).
Government bonds usually have the lowest yields of all investments available and are typically among the
most liquid in any country where they are traded. Government securities will only face significant liquidity
risk in times of great economic distress.
•Duration risk. Duration risk is the risk associated with the sensitivity of a bond’s price to a single 1%
change in interest rates. A bond’sdurationis expressed in numerical measurements. The higher the
duration number, the more sensitive a bond investment will be to changes in interest rates.
10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default301

•Call risk and reinvestment risk.Call riskis the risk of bonds being redeemed or called by the issuing
firm before their maturity dates. Corporations may elect to call a bond issue (provided the bond issue has
a call feature) when interest rates drop and companies are in a position to save a great deal of money by
issuing new bonds with lower coupon rates. To investors, this is a risk in and of itself, but call risk also has
the effect of potentially causing reinvestment risk.Reinvestment riskis defined as the risk to investors
when they find themselves facing unfavorable alternatives for investing the proceeds from their called
bonds in new, lower-paying investments. This can potentially lead to substantial financial loss for the
original bond investors.
•Term risk. Investors will generally demand higher returns for lending funds at fixed interest rates. This is
because doing so exposes them to the risks presented by rising interest rates and the negative impact of
these higher rates on their bond holdings. In a scenario of rising interest rates, investors will find that
their return from lending money through a bond purchase just once, at a fixed interest rate, will be lower
than the return they might have realized from making several different investments for much shorter
periods of time. Term risk is usually measured by a special indicator referred to as theterm premium.
As mentioned above, however, the most common forms of bond risk are interest rate risk and default risk.
Interest Rate Risk
As we have discussed, when interest rates rise, bond values will fall. This is the general concept behind interest
rate risk. Any investor infixed-income securities(such as bonds) will have to contend with interest rate risk at
one time or another. Interest rate risk is also referred to asmarket riskand usually increases the longer an
investor maintains a bond investment.
Default Risk
Any time a bond is purchased, the investor is taking a risk that the bond issuer may be late in making
scheduled payments on a bond issue—or, in the worst case, may not be able to make payments at all. This is
the underlying idea behind the concept of default risk.
Because US Treasury securities have the full backing of the government, they are generally considered free of
default risk. However, most corporate bonds will face some possibility of default. Obviously, some bonds and
their issuing companies are riskier in this respect than others.
To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,bond ratingsare regularly published
by a number of organizations to express their assessment of the risk quality of various bond issues. We will
discuss these bond ratings and the companies that issue them next.
Bond Ratings and Rating Providers
It is important for investors to know the risks they are assuming when investing in bonds. Many investors will
take advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond
issuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.
To help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds,rating agencies (bond rating services)were
established to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then
analyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These
services then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign
individual grades to each bond and its issuing company.
The three largest and best-known bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-
quality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A
bonds (AA or Aa), and so on. Any bond that is rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) / Baa (Moody’s) or higher is referred to as
investment gradeand is considered strong and stable by the investment community (seeTable 10.11).
30210 • Bonds and Bond Valuation
Access for free at openstax.org

It is important to note that investment-grade bonds are among the most popular due to the fact that many
commercial banks, as well as several pension funds, are only allowed to trade bonds that are investment
grade.
Any bond that is below investment grade, or rated lower than BBB (S&P, Fitch) or Baa (Moody’s), is referred to
as a high-yield bond or a junk bond. Junk bonds have had mixed levels of success for companies wishing to
issue them to raise capital. In the early 1990s, the market for junk bonds collapsed, due in part to a political
movement involving influential people who had been dominating corporate debt markets. This movement,
combined with illegal insider trading activities conducted by investments banks, ultimately resulted in the
bankruptcy of former financial giant Drexel Burnham Lambert.

Table10.11Bond Ratings(sources: S&P Global Ratings; Moody’s)
The market for junk bonds enjoyed a brief resurgence in popularity when the economy improved later in the
1990s. However, in 2001, the junk bond market shrank once again, resulting in 11% of US junk bond issues
defaulting.
In general, it is important to understand that bond ratings are only judgments on corporations’ future ability
to repay debt obligation and their growth prospects. There is no fixed methodology or basis for calculating a
bond rating. However, some financial analysts can get a strong indication of how a bond will be rated by
examining certain financial ratios of the issuing firm, such as company debt ratio, earnings-to-interest ratio,
and their return on assets.
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
The Collapse of Enron: Bond and Credit Ratings and How They Change
The bond rating system is not infallible. A perfect example of this is when energy giantEnronfailed in 2001.
After the collapse, investors correctly pointed out that a mere two months before this occurred, the
company’s bonds were rated as investment grade and considered relatively safe, having little risk for
investors.
Background on Enron
From its formation in 1985 through the late 1990s, Enron grew to become an energy mega-conglomerate,
6Lawrence Delevingne. “The Drexel Collapse, 25 Years Later.”CNBC. February 13, 2015. https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/13/the-
drexel-collpase-25-years-later.html
10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default303

expanding into areas such as trading of futures contracts, paper products, electricity, water, pipelines, and
broadband services. Reported revenues grew at an exceptional pace, Enron’s stock price continued to rise,
and business was proceeding exceptionally well.
However, things were not as they appeared on the surface. Enron’s financial statements were often very
confusing to shareholders and analysts. Additionally, Enron’s unscrupulous business practices included
revenue misstatements and other questionable accounting practices to indicate favorable financial
performance. On top of this, some of Enron’s speculative business ventures proved to be disastrous,
resulting in substantial financial losses.
Initial allegations against Enron also focused on the role of their public accountants, Arthur Andersen.
Andersen was one of the Big Five accounting firms in the United States at that time and had served as
Enron’s auditing firm for over 16 years. According to court documents, Enron and Arthur Andersen had
improperly categorized hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions as increases to the company’s
shareholder equity. It was also later discovered that Andersen failed to follow generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) when considering Enron’s dealings with related partnerships. As a result,
Enron was able to conceal some of its losses from the investing public. After investigation by the United
States Justice Department, the firm was indicted on obstruction of justice charges in March 2002. The
combination of all of these irregularities and issues resulted in the December 2, 2001, bankruptcy of the
corporation.
7
It was later determined that the majority of these unethical issues had been perpetuated with
the indirect knowledge or even, in some cases, by the direct actions of the board of directors or senior
operational management of the company.
Specifics and Enron’s Bond Ratings
On October 27, 2001, the company began buying back all its commercial paper, valued at around $3.3
billion, in an effort to calm investor fears about Enron’s supply of cash. On November 8, Enron announced
that restatements to its financial statements for the years 1997–2000 were necessary to correct several
accounting violations. However, by November 28, 2001, credit rating agencies had reduced Enron’s bond
rating to junk status.

Other Examples of Significant Bond Ratings Downgrades
Some companies that have recently experienced downgrades (or potential downgrades) to their credit and
bond ratings includeDelta Airlines,Ford,Occidental Petroleum,Carnival Cruises, andT-Mobil. Some of
these businesses, such as Delta and Carnival, are suffering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the
hope is that they don’t experience the same disastrous fate as Enron.

Concepts of Bond Returns
Bond investors earn profits through two different means: collecting interest income and generatingcapital
gains. These are important concepts for any investor who considers putting their money in fixed-income
securities such as bonds.

Collecting Interest Income
As we have covered, when investors buy bonds, they are lending money to bond issuers. The coupon rate of a
bond is determined by the issuer and is generally tied to the overall level of interest rates in the economy at
the time of issue as well as the maturity period of the bond and the credit rating of the issuer. The established
coupon rate then governs how much periodic interest is paid to bondholders. For example, if an investor
purchases a 5%, $1,000 bond with a 20-year maturity and annual coupon payments, that investor will receive
20 coupon payments equal toorfor a total of $1,000.
Depending on interest and inflation rates over the 20-year period, this could be a very favorable situation
resulting in significantrealized returnfor the investor. However, if interest rates and inflation over the
investment period are at high levels, the investment is not nearly as attractive.
Generating Capital Gains
Many bonds are not held until their maturity dates. Should an investor require funds before maturity, they
have the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the
investor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being
sold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).
For example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that
comparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it
also yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could
simply buy a newly issued bond from an alternate issuer and receive a higher coupon rate.
It is equally possible that prevailing bond rates could fall and an investor could end up selling their bond at a
higher price, thus earning a capital gain.
Bond Laddering as an Investment Strategy
There are several successful strategies for successful bond investments, but perhaps one of the most common
yet ingenious of these strategies is calledbond laddering. Bond ladders help investors achieve diversity in
their portfolios and reduce risk while helping maintain regular cash inflows in the form of coupon payments or
interest. In a bond ladder, an investor will divide their total investment dollars among various bonds that
mature at regular intervals, thereby balancing risk and return. An example of a bond ladder would be to
purchase 10 different bonds that have maturities of one year, two years, three years, and so on, all the way
through to 10 years.
When the first bond matures, the investor will purchase a new bond that matures in 10 years to take its place
in the ladder and continue the overall laddering strategy.
This strategy has several benefits. First, the shorter-term bonds in the ladder provide stability because they are
less sensitive to risk than longer-term bonds. The longer-term bonds within the ladder will generally provide
higher returns but with higher risk due to such factors as rising interest rates. So, by investing in bonds with
different maturities and creating a bond ladder, investors can realize superior financial returns to what they
would earn by only investing in short-term bonds. Also, the general level of risk from a bond ladder is reduced
by the shorter-term component of the investment mix, making the bond ladder less risky than an investment
that only included long-term bonds.
It is easy to see why bond laddering has become such a highly adopted bond investment strategy with
investors ranging from novice to the most well-seasoned and experienced.
Interest Rate Movements and Bond Prices
We now know that when investors buy bonds, either directly or through mutual funds, they are lending money
to bond-issuing firms or governments. In turn, issuers promise to pay back the principal (par or face value)
when the loan is due at the bond’s maturity date.
10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default305

Issuers also promise to pay bondholders periodic interest or coupon payments to compensate them for the
use of their money over the term of the bond. The rate at which issuers pay investors, or the bond’s stated
coupon rate, is typically fixed at the time of issuance.
We have also covered the concept that bond values have an inverse relationship with interest rates. As interest
rates rise, bond prices fall, and when interest rates fall, bond values increase. Movement of interest rates can
have a dramatic effect on a bond’s value and presents the typical bondholder with a number of different
financial risks that we have described in detail.
Also in this chapter, we have discussed how bond values can be estimated through the use of several different
factors. Prevailing interest rates are among the most critical of these, but also important are factors such as
maturity periods, the taxability of bond interest, the credit standing of bond issuers, and the likelihood ofbond
call, or issuers paying off their debt early.
When considering purchasing bonds or any such fixed-income investment, investors should remain aware that
interest rates are always in a state of flux and can change at any time. The movements of bond values and
bond yields will be significantly affected by these changes and can be favorable or unfavorable for any
investor.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Demonstrate bond valuations using Excel.
•Demonstrate bond yield calculations using Excel.
Calculating the Price (Present Value) of a Bond
The following examples illustrate how Microsoft Excel can be used to calculate common bond problems.
Please be sure to refer to the chapters on the time value of money for examples of using spreadsheets to solve
present value problems, as these same concepts are also used in solving bond problems.
You can use the following steps in Excel to determine the price or present value of a coupon bond. Suppose
that a bond has a par or face value of $1,000, pays coupons semiannually at a 4% annual rate, and matures in
15 years. We can assume a YTM rate of 5%.

is ($952.06). The bond face value of FV is $1,000; the time period is, or 14 semiannual periods;
the coupon rate is, or 0.05%; and the coupon payment is $5.00.
1.First, select Formulas from the Excel upper menu bar, and from the dialog box, select Rate (seeFigure
10.16).

2.After the dialog box appears, enter the variables or arguments. As with our earlier examples, we will
use the preferred method of identifying arguments with cell addresses (seeFigure 10.17).

3.Again, after all arguments are entered through their correct cell references, the answer will appear in
the lower left corner of the box. Once satisfied with the result, you can hit Enter to insert this final
calculated value into your spreadsheet. This has been set up in this sheet in cell H10.
As noted above, remember that this is a semiannual rate because it was calculated using semiannual
coupon payments and periods. To express it as an annual YTM rate, you must multiply it by 2.
Calculating the Maturity Period (Term) of a Bond
You can use the following steps in Excel to determine the maturity period or term of a bond. Assume that you
are considering investing in a bond that is selling for $820.00, has a face value of $1,000, and has an annual
coupon rate of 3%. If the YTM is 10%, how long will it be until the bond matures?
1.First, select Formulas from the Excel upper menu bar, and from the dialog box, select Nper (seeFigure
10.18).

3.When arguments have all been entered, the answer will appear in the lower left of the Function
Arguments box, as per the above. We arrive at a final answer of 3.12 years until this bond matures.
Calculating Coupon Rate and Interest (Coupon) Payments
Here is how you would determine the coupon or interest rate and coupon payment using Excel. Assume a
$1,000 face value bond is selling for $595, has 20 years until it matures, and has a YTM of 6.5%. What are the
coupon rate and the periodic coupon payment amount of the bond?

Summary
10.1Characteristics of Bonds
Bonds are typically a basic form of investment that entails a straightforward financial agreement between
issuer and purchaser. There are three primary categories of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and
convertible bonds. These different types of bond vary depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest
rate, and risk.
10.2Bond Valuation
It is important to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. We can price a
bond using an equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet. The essential steps are (1) identify the amount and
timing of the future cash flow; (2) determine the discount rate; (3) find the present values of the lump sum
principal and the annuity stream of coupons; and (4) add the present value of the lump sum principal and the
present value of the coupons.
10.3Using the Yield Curve
When interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are
connected, the resulting line is called the yield curve. The yield curve is a graphical representation of the term
structure of interest rates. A yield curve always shows the value of yields (rates) on they-axis and maturities or
time periods on thex-axis.
10.4Risks of Interest Rates and Default
Because bonds are fixed-income investments, they are subject to a number of risks that could have negative
effects on their market value. The most common and best-known risks are interest rate risk and default risk,
but there are some others risks that should be understood, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, duration risk, call
risk, investment risk, and term risk. To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,
bond ratings have been developed and are regularly published by a number of organizations to express their
assessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.
10.5Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems
Microsoft Excel can be used to solve common bond problems. It can be used to calculate the value of a coupon
bond, the yield to maturity (interest rate) of a bond, the maturity period of a bond, and the coupon rate and
interest (coupon) payments of a bond.

Why It Matters
Similar to bonds, shares ofcommon stockentitle investor owners to a portion of a company’s future earnings
and cash flows. However, stocks differ significantly from bonds in how they are issued and managed by
companies, the methodology used to calculate their values in public markets, and how they can generate
income and eventual value for individual investors.
With common stock, there is no specific promise of how much cash investors will receive or when they will
receive it. This differs from bond investments, which are valued entirely on the basis of their guaranteed
timing of future cash flows to bondholders.
This means that with stocks, there are no maturity dates, face values, or coupon payment guarantees. It also
means that stocks do not promise any specified cash flows in the form of coupons or a face value payment at
some point in the future. Instead, stocks (only some, not all) may pay dividends. These dividends are declared
after shares of stock have been issued by a company and then purchased by the investing public. Following a
dividend declaration, the designated per-share amounts are paid to shareholders of record on a specified
date, also determined by a company’s board.
Because stock investments carry no guarantee of payments to investors, they are far riskier than bonds and
other forms of fixed-income investments.
While there are many reasons for an investor to choose to purchase common stock, three of the most

common reasons are
•to use stocks as instruments or repositories for maintaining value;
•to accumulate wealth over the term of the stock investment; and
•to earn income through capital gains and dividend payments.
As with any financial instrument, common stock purchases offer advantages and disadvantages to investors.
Important advantages include the following:
•Returns through dividends and price appreciation of shares can be substantial.
•Stocks are a liquid form of investment and can be bought or sold withinsecondary marketsrelatively
easily.
•Information about companies, markets, and important trends are widely published and readily available
to the investing public.
These advantages are significant and lead many individuals to move into stock investments. Yet it is important
to realize that stock has some significant disadvantages, which can include the following:
•General risk levels are greater than with bonds or other fixed-income investments.
•Timing the buy-and-sell transactions of stock can be tricky and may lead to losses or not taking full
advantage of share price opportunities.
•Dividends (provided that the stock does indeed pay them, as not all do) are uncertain and subject to
change based on decisions of company management.
We will discuss these topics in this chapter and cover many of the details regarding why corporations issue
common stock and why investors purchase that stock.

The Price-to Earnings (P/E) Ratio
Experienced investors use a number of different methods to evaluate information on companies and their
common stock before deciding on any potential purchase. One of the most popular techniques used by
investors and analysts is to study a company’s financial statements in order to uncover basic fundamental
information on the company. This involves calculating a number of financial ratios that help identify trends,
bringing elements of operational performance to light and allowing for clearer analysis and evaluation.
A well-proven analytical approach for investors to use in evaluating common stock is to review the overall
market value of the company that issues a stock. One of the most consistently used calculations in this
analysis, which has important applications in company and common stock evaluation, is theprice-to-earnings
(P/E) ratio.
The P/E ratio is computed using the following formula:
32011 • Stocks and Stock Valuation
Access for free at openstax.org

The P/E ratio is extremely useful to analysts in that it shows the expectations of the market. Essentially, the P/E
ratio is representative of the price an investor must pay for every unit of current (or future) corporate
earnings.
Bottom-line earnings are a critical factor in valuing common stock. Investors will always want to know how
profitable a company is now as well as how profitable it will be in the future. When a company’s bottom line
remains relatively flat over a period of time, leavingearnings per share (EPS)relatively unchanged, the P/E
ratio can be interpreted as the payback period for the original amount paid for each share of common stock.
For example, the common stock price of Cameo Corp. is currently at $24.00 a share, and its EPS for the year is
$4.00. Cameo’s P/E ratio is calculated as
This ratio would typically be expressed in the form. Essentially, this means that investors are willing to pay
up to six dollars for every one dollar of earnings. It can also be stated that Cameo stock is currently trading at
a multiple of six.
The P/E ratio is typically expressed in two primary ways. The first is as a metric listed by most finance websites
and often carries the notationP/E (ttm). This refers to the Wall Street acronym for “trailing 12 months” and
signals the company’s operating performance over the past 12 months.
Another form of the P/E ratio is known as the forward (or leading) P/E. This uses future earnings projections
rather than actual trailing amounts. The leading P/E, sometimes called theestimated price to earnings, is
useful for comparing current earnings to future earnings and helps provide a clearer picture of what earnings
may look like, assuming there are no major changes in the company’s operations or accounting treatments.
Referring back to our calculation for Cameo Corp. above, because the current EPS was used in the calculation,
this ratio would be classified as a trailing P/E ratio. If we had used an estimated or projected EPS as the
denominator in the calculation, it would then be considered a leading P/E ratio.
Analyzing a company’s P/E ratio alone or within a vacuum will actually tell an analyst very little. It is only when
a company’s P/E is compared to historical P/E ratios or the P/E ratios of other companies in the same industry
that it becomes a useful tool for analysis. One of the most important benefits of using comparative P/E ratios
is that they can standardize stocks with different prices and various earnings levels.
Generally speaking, it is very difficult to make any conclusions about a stand-alonestock value, such as
whether a stock that has a ratio ofis a good buy at its current price or if a stock with a P/E ratio ofis
too expensive, without performing any relevant comparisons or further analysis.
Analysts have many different ways to interpret P/E ratio data. One of the most common interpretations is that
firms with high P/E ratios should be growth companies. Also, a high P/E ratio could mean that a stock’s price is
high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. This could signal a possible undesired downward
adjustment in market price in the future.
We can extrapolate from the argument above to put forward the idea that stocks with low P/E ratios should be
stabler, more mature organizations. A low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to
earnings and that there may be an opportunity to take advantage of upward price movements and potential
investment gains through stock price appreciation.
While this information is often very useful for evaluating stocks and making investment decisions, caution
must always be used, as a current stock price may simply be out of line with the company’s earning potential,
which would mean that price adjustments are likely to occur in the short term. This is why experienced
analysts and investors will use multiple evaluation techniques when conducting stock analysis and evaluation
and not rely solely on insights provided by a single set of facts or one form of statistical measurement.
11.1 • Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation321

The Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
Another financial ratio commonly used by investors and analysts is theprice-to-book (P/B) ratio, also called
the market-to-book (M/B) ratio. This is a financial metric used to evaluate a company’s current market value
relative to its book value.
The market value, ormarket capitalization, of a company is defined as the current price of all its outstanding
shares of common stock. This is essentially equal to the total value of the company as perceived by the market.
For all intents and purposes, the book value is representative of the residual of a company after it has
liquidated all assets and paid off all of its liabilities.
Book value can be determined by performing some financial analysis on a company’s balance sheet.
Essentially, analysts will use the P/B ratio to compare a business’s available net assets relative to the current
sales price of its stock. The price-to-book-value ratio formula is
One of the primary uses of the P/B ratio is to understand market perceptions of a particular stock’s value. It is
often the metric of choice for evaluating financial services firms such as real estate firms, insurance
companies, and investment trusts. The P/B ratio has a notable shortcoming, however, in that it does not
evaluate companies that have a high level ofintangible assetssuch as patents, trademarks, and copyrights.
Ultimately, this ratio will tell an analyst exactly how much potential investors are willing to pay for each dollar
of asset value. The PB(M/B) ratio is computed by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the
company’s current book value per share, which is calculated by either of the following two equations:
Net book valueis equal to net assets, or the total assets minus the total liabilities of the company.
Analysts often consider a low P/B ratio (less than 1) to indicate that a stock is undervalued and a higher ratio
(greater than 1) to mean that a stock is overvalued.A low ratio may be an indication that something is wrong
with the company or that an investor may be paying too much for any residual value should the company be
liquidated.
However, many market experts will argue the exact opposite of the above interpretations. Because of these
discrepancies in interpretation and overall variance of opinion, the use of alternate stock valuation metrics,
either in addition to or in place of the P/B ratio, is always worth exploring.
In conclusion, the P/B ratio can help a company understand if its net assets are comparable to the market
price of its stock. However, as with the P/E ratio, it is always a good idea to compare P/B ratios of companies
within the same industry and use them in conjunction with other metrics and analytical methodologies.

Alternative Multipliers
There are two main types of valuation metrics multiples used to value common stock. These areequity
multiplesandenterprise value (EV) multiples. Additionally, there are two primary methods by which to
perform analysis using these multiples. These methods arecomparable company analysis (comps)and
precedent transaction analysis (precedents).
Experienced financial analysts advocate the use of multiples in valuation analysis for a number of reasons, the
most important being that they help generate realistic and sound judgments of enterprise values (total
company values), they are relatively easy to use and interpret, and they can provide helpful information on a
company’s overall financial condition when used appropriately.
However, it should be noted that simplicity may have some important disadvantages. When such complex
information is reduced to a single equation or final value, it can easily be misunderstood, and the influence of
important factors may be masked or lost in the evaluation process.
What’s more, the calculation of multiples represents a snapshot in time for a firm and cannot easily show how
a company grows or progresses. Thus, these calculations are only applicable to short-term analysis, not to
long-term scenarios.
Equity Multiples
Equity multiples are especially useful for investment decisionswhen an investor aspires to minority positions
in companies. Below are some common equity multiples used in valuation analyses.
The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which we discussed earlier, is probably the most common equity multiple
used in stock valuation because it is relatively simple to calculate and all necessary data are easily accessible by
analysts and investors. The market-to-book (M/B), or price-to-book (P/B), ratio is also useful if assets primarily
drive a company’s earnings. Again, it is computed as the proportion of share price to book value per share.
Dividend yieldis another form of equity multiple and is primarily used when conducting comparisons
between cash returns and investment types. Dividend yield is computed as the proportion ofdividendper
share to share price. Theprice-to-sales (P/S) ratiois an additional metric used for firms that are experiencing
financial losses. The P/S ratio is often used for quick estimates and is computed as the proportion of share
price to sales (or revenue) per share.
Another useful metric is theprice-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio. The P/CF ratio is used to compare a company’s
market value to its operating cash flow (or the company’s stock price per share to its operating cash flow per
share). This measurement is suitable only in certain cases, such as when a company has substantial noncash
expenses (e.g.,depreciationoramortization). In some situations, companies may have positive cash flows
but still show a bottom-line loss due to large noncash expenses. The P/CF ratio is helpful for arriving at a less
distorted view of such a company’s value.
While these various metrics are important, a financial analyst must always consider that companies often
operate under their own unique sets of circumstances that ultimately will influence many of these equity
multiples.
Enterprise Value (EV) Multiples
The following are some common EV multiples used in valuation analyses:
Gordon growth model is as follows
11.1 • Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation323

EV multiples take an increasingly important role when value decisions surround recent mergers and
acquisitions.Enterprise value (EV)is a measurement of the total value of a company. Companies often
believe that EV offers a more accurate representation of a firm’s total value than a basic market capitalization
method. Generally, EV is perceived to offer an aggregate value of the firm as an enterprise, which is a more
comprehensive measurement (seeFigure 11.2).
Figure11.2Enterprise Value: The Complete Picture
Following are two of the most common enterprise values metrics used in valuing companies and their
common stock:
EV/Revenue (EV/R).Also called EV/Sales, EV/R is a valuation metric used to understand a company’s total
valuation compared to its annual sales levels. EV/R can help provide an analyst with an idea of exactly how
much investors pay for every dollar of a company’s sales revenue.
EV/R is considered a relatively crude metric but can be useful when analyzing companies that have different
methods of revenue recognition. P/E ratios, for example, can be significantly affected by changes in the
accounting policies of companies being evaluated. This is another reason why multiple metrics should be used
in valuations.
Additionally, EV/R is a useful measure for companies that are consuming cash or experiencing financial losses.
Such companies may be start-ups or emerging technology firms that have not fully matured and are still in a
growth stage of development.
EV/EBIT.A firm’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is an indicator of its profitability before the effects
of interest or taxes. EBIT is also referred to as operating earnings, operating profit, and profit before interest
and tax.
•EV/EBITDA.EV/EBITDA is a ratio that compares a company’s enterprise value (EV) to its earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). EBITDA is often used by analysts as a substitute
for cash flow and can be applied to capital analysis using tools such as net present value and internal rate
of return. It is relatively easy to calculate, as all information required to compete the calculation is

available from any publicly traded company’s financial statements. Because of this, the EV/EBITDA ratio is
a commonly used metric to compare the relative values of different businesses.
•EV/EBITDAR.Another form of valuation based on enterprise value is EV/EBITDAR. This metric divides
enterprise value by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, and rental costs (EBITDAR).
This multiple is used in businesses that have substantial rental and lease expenses, such as hotel chains
and airlines. Capital investment can differ significantly for these firms, and when assets are leased, these
companies tend to have artificially lower debt and operating income compared to firms that actually own
their assets.
EV/Capital Employed.The EV-to-capital employedratio is a measure of enterprise value compared to the
level of capital used by a business. For example, a business with a large capital basis is bound to carry a large
enterprise value simply due to its large capital holdings.
Final Thoughts on Valuation Ratios and Multiples
There are many equity and enterprise value multiples used in company valuation, but the discussions above
cover those that are most commonly used. In any case, gaining a thorough understanding of each multiple
and its related concepts can help analysts make better use of these metrics in their stock analysis and
valuation efforts. Also, as discussed, it is important that analysts and technicians use multiple ratios and
alternate measures for any evaluation of a company and its common stock. Not doing so will limit the ultimate
interpretation of the results, can lead to incorrect conclusions, and may cause fundamental mistakes in overall
investment strategy.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Identify and use DDMs (dividend discount models).
•Define the constant growth DDM.
•List the assumptions and limitations of the Gordon growth model.
•Understand and be able to use the various forms of DDM.
•Explain the advantages and limitations of DDMs.
Thedividend discount model (DDM)is a method used to value a stock based on the concept that its worth is
the present value of all of its future dividends. Using the stock’s price, a required rate of return, and the value
of the next year’s dividend, investors can determine a stock’s value based on the total present value of future
dividends.
This means that if an investor is buying a stock primarily based on its dividend, the DDM can be a useful tool to
determine exactly how much of the stock’s price is supported by future dividends. However, it is important to
11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)325

understand that the DDM is not without flaws and that using it requires assumptions to be made that, in the
end, may not prove to be true.
The Gordon Growth Model
The most common DDM is theGordon growth model, which uses the dividend for the next year (D
1
), the
required return(r), and the estimated future dividendgrowth rate(g) to arrive at a final price or value of the
stock. The formula for the Gordon growth model is as follows:
This calculation values the stock entirely on expected future dividends. You can then compare the calculated
price to the actual market price in order to determine whether purchasing the stock at market will meet your
requirements.

Dividend Discount Model
Watch thisshort video on the dividend discount model(https://openstax.org/r/

The Gordon growth model equation is presented and then applied to a sample problem to demonstrate
how the DDM yields an estimated share price for the stock of any company.
Now that we have been introduced to the basic idea behind the dividend discount model, we can move on to
cover other forms of DDM.
Zero Growth Dividend Discount Model
The zero growth DDM assumes that all future dividends of a stock will be fixed at essentially the same dollar
value forever, or at least for as long as an individual investor holds the shares of stock. In such a case, the
stock’sintrinsic valueis determined by dividing the annual dividend amount by the required rate of return:
When examined closely, it can be seen that this is the exact same formula that is used to calculate the present
value of a perpetuity, which is
For the purpose of using this formula in stock valuation, we can express this as
where PV is equal to the price or value of the stock,Drepresents the dividend payment, andrrepresents the
required rate of return.
This makes perfect sense because a stock that pays the exact same dividend amount forever is no different
from aperpetuity—a continuous, never-ending annuity—and for this reason, the same formula can be used
to price preferred stock. The only factor that might alter the value of a stock based on the zero-growth model
would be a change in the required rate of return due to fluctuations in perceived risk levels.

Example:
What is the intrinsic value of a stock that pays $2.00 in dividends every year if the required rate of return on
similar investments in the market is 6%?
Solution:
We can apply the zero growth DDM formula to get
While this model is relatively easy to understand and to calculate, it has one significant flaw: it is highly unlikely
that a firm’s stock would pay the exact same dollar amount in dividends forever, or even for an extended
period of time. As companies change and grow, dividend policies will change, and it naturally follows that the
payout of dividends will also change. This is why it is important to become familiar with other DDMs that may
be more practical in their use.
Constant Growth Dividend Discount Model
As indicated by its name, the constant growth DDM assumes that a stock’s dividend payments will grow at a
fixed annual percentage that will remain the same throughout the period of time they are held by an investor.
While the constant growth DDM may be more realistic than the zero growth DDM in allowing for dividend
growth, it assumes that dividends grow by the same specific percentage each year. This is also an unrealistic
assumption that can present problems when attempting to evaluate companies such asAmazon,Facebook,
Google, or other organizations that do not pay dividends. Constant growth models are most often used to
value mature companies whose dividend payments have steadily increased over a significant period of time.
When applied, the constant growth DDM will generate the present value of an infinite stream of dividends that
are growing at a constant rate.
The constant growth DDM formula is
whereD
0
is the value of the dividend received this year,D
1
is the value of the dividend to be received next
year,gis the growth rate of the dividend, andris the required rate of return.
As can be seen above, after simplification, the constant growth DDM formula becomes the Gordon growth
model formula and works in the same way. Let’s look at some examples.
THINK IT THROUGH
Constant Growth DDM: Example 1
If a stock is paying a dividend of $5.00 this year and the dividend has been steadily growing at 4% annually,
what is the intrinsic value of the stock, assuming an investor’s required rate of return of 8%?
Solution:
Apply the constant growth DDM formula:
Simplify to the Gordon growth model:

So, the growth rate is 7.69%.

In this video for the Investing for Beginners course and podcast,Andrew Sather introduces the DDM,

DDM (Gordon growth model) and the two-stage DDM.
Variable or Nonconstant Growth Dividend Discount Model
Many experienced analysts prefer to use the variable (nonconstant) growth DDM because it is a much closer
approximation of businesses’ actual dividend payment policies, making it much closer to reality than other
forms of DDM. The variable growth model is based on the real-life assumption that a company and its stock
value will progress through different stages of growth.
The variable growth model is estimated by extending the constant growth model to include a separate
calculation for each growth period. Determine present values for each of these periods, and then add them all
together to arrive at the intrinsic value of the stock. The variable growth model is more involved than other
DDM methods, but it is not overly complex and will often provide a more realistic and accurate picture of a
stock’s true value.
As an example of the variable growth model, let’s say that Maddox Inc. paid $2.00 per share in common stock
dividends last year. The company’s policy is to increase its dividends at a rate of 5% for four years, and then
the growth rate will change to 3% per year from the fifth year forward. What is the present value of the stock if
the required rate of return is 8%? The calculation is shown inTable 11.1.

Two-Stage Dividend Discount Model
The two-stage DDM is a methodology used to value a dividend-paying stock and is based on the assumption of
two primary stages of dividend growth: an initial period of higher growth and a subsequent period of lower,
more stable growth.
The two-stage DDM is often used with mature companies that have an established track record of making
residual cash dividend payments while experiencing moderate rates of growth. Many analysts like to use the
two-stage model because it is reasonably grounded in reality. For example, it is probably a more reasonable
assumption that a firm that had an initial growth rate of 10% might see its growth drop to a more modest level
of, say, 5% as the company becomes more established and mature, rather than assuming that the firm will
maintain the initial growth rate of 10%. Experts tend to agree that firms that have higher payout ratios of
dividends may be well suited to the two-stage DDM.
As we have seen, the assumptions of the two-stage model are as follows:
•The first period analyzed will be one of high initial growth.
•This stage of higher growth will eventually transition into a period of more mature, stable, and sustainable
growth at a lower rate than the initial high-growth period.
•The dividend payout ratio will be based on company performance and the expected growth rate of its
operations.
Let’s use an example. Lore Ltd. estimates that its dividend growth will be 13% per year for the next five years.
It will then settle to a sustainable, constant, and continuing rate of 5%. Let’s say that the current year’s
dividend is $14 and the required rate of return (or discount rate) is 12%. What is the current value of Lore Ltd.
stock?
Step 1:
First, we will need to calculate the dividends for each year until the second, stable growth rate phase is
reached. Based on the current dividend value of $14 and the anticipated growth rate of 13%, the values of
dividends (D

) can be determined for each year of the first phase. Because the stable growth
rate is achieved in the second phase, after five years have passed, if we assume that the current year is 2021,
we can lay out the profile for this stock’s dividends through the year 2026, as perFigure 11.3.
11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)329

Figure11.3Profile of Stock Dividend through 2026
Step 2:
Next, we apply the DDM to determine the terminal value, or the value of the stock at the end of the five-year
high-growth phase and the beginning of the second, lower growth-phase.
We can apply the DDM formula at any point in time, but in this example, we are working with a stock that has
constant growth in dividends for five years and then decreases to a lower growth rate in its secondary phase.
Because of this timing and dividend structure, we calculate the value of the stock five years from now, or the
terminal value. Again, this is calculated at the end of the high-growth phase, in 2026. By applying the constant
growth DDM formula, we arrive at the following:
The terminal value can be calculated by applying the DDM formula in Excel, as seen inFigure 11.4andFigure
11.5. The terminal value, or the value at the end of 2026, is $386.91.

Figure11.5Terminal Value at the End of 2026
Step 3:

Next, we find the PV of all paid dividends that occur during the high-growth period of 2022–2026. This is shown
inFigure 11.6. Our required rate of return (discount rate) is 12%.
Figure11.6Present Value of All Paid Dividends, 2022–2026
Step 4:
Next, we calculate the PV of the single lump-sum terminal value:
Remember that due to the sign convention, either the FV must be entered as a negative value or, if entered as
a positive value, the resulting PV will be negative. This example shows the former.
Step 5:
Our next step is to find the current fair (intrinsic) value of the stock, which comprises the PV of all future
dividends plus the PV of the terminal value. This is represented in the following formula, with all factors shown
inFigure 11.7:
Figure11.7Fair Value of the Stock

So, we end up with a total current fair value of Lore Ltd. stock of $291.44 (due to Excel’s rounding), although
the sum can also be calculated as shown below:

Advantages and Limitations of DDMs
Some of the primary advantages of DDMs are their basis in the sound logic of present value concepts, their
consistency, and the implication that companies that pay dividends tend to be mature and stable entities. Also,
because the model is essentially a mathematical formula, there is little room for misinterpretation or
subjectivity. As a result of these advantages, DDMs are a very popular form of stock evaluation that most
analysts show faith in.
Because dividends are paid in cash, companies may keep making their dividend payments even when doing so
is not in their best long-term interests. They may not want to manipulate dividend payments, as this can
directly lead to stock price volatility. Rather, they may manipulate dividend payments in the interest of buoying
up their stock price.
To further illustrate limitations of DDMs, let’s examine the Concepts in Practice case.
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Limitations of DDMs
A major limitation of the dividend discount model is that it cannot be used to value companies that do not
pay dividends. This is becoming a growing trend, particularly for young high-tech companies. Warren
Buffett, CEO ofBerkshire Hathaway, has stated that companies are usually better off if they take their
excess funds and reinvest them into infrastructure, evolving technologies, and other profitable ventures.
The payment of dividends to shareholders is “almost a last resort for corporate management,”
1
says
Buffett, and cash balances should be invested in “projects to become more efficient, expand territorially,
extend and improve product lines or . . . otherwise widen the economic moat separating the company from
its competitors.”
2
Berkshire follows this practice of reinvesting cash rather than paying dividends, as do
tech companies such asAmazon,Google, andBiogen.
3
So, rather than receiving cash dividends,
stockholders of these companies are rewarded by seeing stock price appreciation in their investments and
ultimately large capital gains when they finally decide to sell their shares.
The sensitivity of assumptions is also a drawback of using DDMs. The fair price of a stock can be highly
sensitive to growth rates and the required rates of return demanded by investors. A single percentage
point change in either of these two factors can have a dramatic impact on a company’s stock, potentially
changing it by as much as 10 to 20%.

Finally, the results obtained using DDMs may not be related to the results of a company’s operations or its
profitability. Dividend payments should theoretically be tied to a company’s profitability, but in some
instances, companies will make misguided efforts to maintain a stable dividend payout even through the
use of increased borrowing and debt, which is not beneficial to an organization’s long-term financial health.

Stock Valuation with Changing Growth Rates and Time Horizons
Before we move on from our discussion of dividend discount models, let’s work through some more examples
of how the DDM can be used with a number of different scenarios, changing growth rates, and time horizons.
As we have seen, the value or price of a financial asset is equal to the present value of the expected future
cash flows received while maintaining ownership of the asset. In the case of stock, investors receive cash flows
in the form of dividends from the company, plus a final payout when they decide to relinquish their ownership
rights or sell the stock.
Let’s look at a simple illustration of the price of a single share of common stock when we know the future
dividends and final selling price.
Problem:
Steve wants to purchase shares of Old Peak Construction Company and hold these common shares for five
years. The company will pay $5.00 annual cash dividends per share for the next five years.
At the end of the five years, Steve will sell the stock. He believes that he will be able to sell the stock for $25.00
per share. If Steve wants to earn 10% on this investment, what price should he pay today for this stock?
Solution:
The current price of the stock is the discounted cash flow that Steve will receive over the next five years while
holding the stock. If we let the final price represent a lump-sum future value and treat the dividend payments
as an annuity stream over the next five years, we can apply the time value of money concepts we covered in
earlier chapters.
Method 1: Using an Equation
Method 2: Using a Financial Calculator
We can also use a calculator or spreadsheet to find the price of the stock (seeTable 11.2).

In cases such as the above, we find the present value of a dividend stream and the present value of the lump-
sum future price. So, if we know the dividend stream, the future price of the stock, the future selling date of
the stock, and the required return, it is possible to price stocks in the same manner that we price bonds.

Even though we anticipate that companies will be in business “forever,” we are not going to own a company’s
stock forever. Therefore, the dividend stream to which we would have legal claim is only for that period of the
company’s life during which we own the stock. We need to modify the dividend model to account for a finite
period when we will sell the stock at some future time. This modification brings us from an infinite to a finite
dividend pricing model, which we will use to price a finite amount of dividends and the future selling price of
the stock. We will maintain a constant dividend assumption. Let’s assume we will hold a share in a company
that pays a $1 dividend for 20 years and then sell the stock.
Method 1: Using an Equation
The dividend pricing model under a finite horizon is a concept we have seen earlier. It is a simple present value
annuity stream application:
We now need to determine the selling price that we would get in 20 years if we were to sell the stock to
someone else at that time. What would a willing buyer give us for the stock 20 years from now? This price is
difficult to estimate, so for the sake of this exercise, we will assume that the price in 20 years will be $30. So,
what is the present value of the price in 20 years with a 10% discount rate? Again, this is just a simple
application of the PV formula we covered earlier in the text:
We can now price the stock as if it were a bond with a dividend stream of 20 years, a sales price in 20 years,
and a required return of 10%:
•The dividend stream is analogous to the coupon payments.
•The sales price is analogous to the bond’s principal.
•The 20-year investment horizon is analogous to the bond’s maturity date.
•The required return is analogous to the bond’s yield.
Carrying on with the PV calculations, we have

Example 2:
Let’s look at an example and estimate current stock price given a 10.44% constant growth rate of dividends
forever and a desired return on the stock of 13.5%. We will assume that the current stock owner has just
received the most recent dividend,D
0
, and the new buyer will receive all future cash dividends, beginning with
D
1
. This part of the setup of the model is important because the price reflects all future dividends, starting with
D
1
, discounted back to today. (Price
0
refers to the price at time zero, or today.) The first dividend the buyer
would receive is one full period away. Using the discounted cash flow approach, we have
wheregis the annual growth rate of the dividends andris the required rate of return on the stock. We can
simplify the equation above into the following:
As we discussed above, this classic model of constant dividend growth, known as the Gordon growth model, is

a fundamental method of stock pricing. The Gordon growth model determines a stock’s value based on a
future stream of dividends that grows at a constant rate. Again, we assume that this constantly growing
dividend stream will pay forever. To see how the constant growth model works, let’s use our example from
above once again as a test case. The most recent dividend (D

) is $1.76, the growth rate (g) is 10.44%, and the
required rate of return (r) is 13.5%, so applying our PV equation, we have
Our estimated price for this example is $63.52. Notice that the formula requires the return raterto be greater
than the growth rategof the dividend stream. Ifgwere greater thanr, we would be dividing by a negative
number and producing a negative price, which would be meaningless.
Let’s pick another company and see if we can apply the dividend growth model and price the company’s stock
with a different dividend history. In addition, our earlier example will provide a shortcut method to estimateg,
although you could still calculate each year’s percentage change and then average the changes over the 10
years.
Estimating a Stock Price from a Past Dividend Pattern
Problem:
Phased Solutions Inc. has paid the following dividends per share from 2011 to 2020:
2011201220132014201520162017201820192020
$0.070$0.080$0.925$1.095$1.275$1.455$1.590$1.795$1.930$2.110
Table11.4
If you plan to hold this stock for 10 years, believe Phased Solutions will continue this dividend pattern forever,
and you want to earn 17% on your investment, what would you be willing to pay per share of Phased Solutions
stock as of January 1, 2021?
Solution:
First, we need to estimate the annual growth rate of this dividend stream. We can use a shortcut to determine
the average growth rate by using the first and last dividends in the stream and the time value of money
equation. We want to find the average growth rate given an initial dividend (present value) of $0.70, the most
recent dividend (future value) of $2.11, and the number of years (n) between the two dividends, or the number
of dividend changes, which is 9. So, we calculate the average growth rate as follows:
Table 11.5shows the step-by-step process of using a financial calculator to solve for the growth rate.

The calculated growth rate is 13.04%.
We can also use Excel to set up a spreadsheet similar to the one inFigure 11.10that will calculate this growth
rate.
Figure11.10Excel Solution for Growth Rate
The Excel command used in cell G22 to calculate the growth rate is as follows:
=RATE(nper,pmt,pv,[fv],[type],[guess])
We now have two methods to estimateg, the growth rate of the dividends. The first method, calculating the
change in dividend each year and then averaging these changes, is the arithmetic approach. The second
method, using the first and last dividends only, is the geometric approach. The arithmetic approach is
equivalent to a simple interest approach, and the geometric approach is equivalent to a compound interest
approach.
To apply our PV formula above, we had to assume that the company would pay dividends forever and that we
would hold on to our stock forever. If we assume that we will sell the stock at some point in the future,
however, can we use this formula to estimate the value of a stock held for a finite period of time? The answer
is a qualified yes. We can adjust this model for a finite horizon to estimate the present value of the dividend
stream that we will receive while holding the stock. We will still have a problem estimating the stock’s selling
price at the end of this finite dividend stream, and we will address this issue shortly. For the finite growing
dividend stream, we adjust the infinite stream in our earlier equation to the following:
wherenis the number of future dividends.
This equation may look very complicated, but just focus on the far right part of the model. This part calculates
the percentage of the finite dividend stream that you will receive if you sell the stock at the end of thenth year.
Say you will sell Johnson & Johnson after 10 years. What percentage of the $60.23 (the finite dividend stream)
will you get? Begin with the following:
33811 • Stocks and Stock Valuation
Access for free at openstax.org

Now, multiply the result by the price for your portion of the infinite stream:
The next step is to discount the selling price of Johnson & Johnson in 10 years at 17% and then add the two
values to get the stock’s price. So, how do we estimate the stock’s price at the end of 10 years? If we elect to
sell the stock after 10 years and the company will continue to pay dividends at the same growth rate, what
would a buyer be willing to pay? How could we estimate the selling price (value) of the stock at that time?
We need to estimate the dividend in 10 years and assume a growth rate and the required return of the new
owner at that point in time. Let’s assume that the new owner also wants a 17% return and that the dividend
growth rate will remain at 13.04%. We calculate the dividend in 10 years by taking the current growth rate plus
one raised to the tenth power times the current dividend:
We then use the dividend growth model with infinite horizon to determine the price in 10 years as follows:
Your price for the stock today—given that you will receive the growing dividend stream for 10 years and sell
for $258.10 in 10 years, and also given that you want a 17% return over the 10 years—is as shown below:
Why did you get the same price of $60.23 for your stock with both the infinite growth model and the finite
model? The reason is that the required rate of return of the stock remained at 17% (your rate) and the growth
rate of the dividends remained at 13.04%. The infinite growth model gives the same price as the finite model
with a future selling price as long as the required return and the growth rate are the same for all future sales
of the stock.
Although this point may be subtle, what we have just shown is that a stock’s price is the present value of its
future dividend stream. When you sell the stock, the buyer purchases the remaining dividend stream. If that
individual should sell the stock in the future, the new owner would buy the remaining dividends. That will
always be the case; a stock’s buyer is always buying the future dividend stream.

THINK IT THROUGH
Nonconstant Growth Dividends
One final issue to address in this section is how we price a stock when dividends are neither constant nor
growing at a constant rate. This can make things a bit more complicated. When a future pattern is not an
annuity or the modified annuity stream of constant growth, there is no shortcut. You have to estimate every
11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)339

future dividend and then discount each individual dividend back to the present. All is not lost, however.
Sometimes you can see patterns in the dividends. For example, a firm might shift into a dividend stream
pattern that will allow you to use one of the dividend models to take a shortcut for pricing the stock. Let’s
look at an example.
JM and Company is a small start-up firm that will institute a dividend payment—a $0.25 dividend—for the
first time at the end of this year. The company expects rapid growth over the next four years and will
increase its dividend to $0.50, then to $1.50, and then to $3.00 before settling into a constant growth
dividend pattern with dividends growing at 5% every year (seeTable 11.6). If you believe that JM and
Company will deliver this dividend pattern and you desire a 13% return on your investment, what price
should you pay for this stock?
T0T1T2T3T4T5
$0.25$0.50$1.50$1.275$3.00
Table11.6
Solution:To price this stock, we will need to discount the first four dividends at 13% and then discount the
constant growth portion of the dividends, the first payment of which will be received at the end of year 5.
Let’s calculate the first four dividends:
We now turn to the constant growth dividend pattern, where we can use our infinite horizon constant
growth model as follows:
This figure is the price of the constant growth portion at the end of the fourth period, so we still need to
discount it back to the present at the 13% required rate of return:
So, the price of this stock with a nonconstant dividend pattern is
Some Final Thoughts on Dividend Discount Models
The dividend used to calculate a price is the expected future payout and expected future dividend growth. This
means the DDM is most useful when valuing companies that have long, consistent dividend records.
If the DDM formula is applied to a company with a limited dividend history, or in an industry exposed to
significant risks that could affect a company’s ability to maintain its payout, the resulting derived value may
not be entirely accurate.
In most cases, dividend models, whether constant growth or constant dividend, appeal to a fundamental
concept of asset pricing: the future cash flow to which the owner is entitled while holding the asset and the
required rate of return for that cash flow determine the value of a financial asset. However, problems can arise
when using these models because the timing and amounts of future cash flows may be difficult to predict.

11.3Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain how the DCF model differs from DDMs.
•Apply the DCF model.
•Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the DCF model.
When investors buy stock, they do so in order to receive cash inflows at different points in time in the future.
These inflows come in the form of cash dividends (provided the stock does indeed pay dividends, because not
all do) and also in the form of the final cash inflow that will occur when the investor decides to sell the stock.
The investor hopes that the final sale price of the stock will be higher than the purchase price, resulting in a
capital gain. The hope for capital gains is even stronger in the case of stocks that do not pay dividends. When
securities have been held for at least one year, the seller is eligible for long-term capital gains tax rates, which
are lower than short-term rates for most investors. This makes non-dividend-paying stocks even more
attractive, provided that they do indeed appreciate in value over the investor’s holding period. Meanwhile,
short-term gains, or gains made on securities held for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income tax
rates, which are usually higher and offer no particular advantage to an investor in terms of reducing their
taxes.
Understanding How the DCF Model Differs from DDMs
The valuation of an asset is typically based on the present value of future cash flows that are generated by the
asset. It is no different with common stock, which brings us to another form of stock valuation: the
discounted cash flow (DCF)model. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young
and do not pay dividends to their shareholders. Examples of such companies includeFacebook,Amazon,
Google,Biogen, andMonster Beverage. The DCF model differs from the dividend discount models we covered
earlier, as DDM methodologies are almost entirely based on a stock’s periodic dividends.
The DCF model is an absolute valuation model, meaning that it does not involve comparisons with other firms
within any specific industry but instead uses objective data to evaluate a company on a stand-alone basis. The
DCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows, determining the present value of the entire organization and
then working this down to the share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.
This highly regarded methodology is the evaluation tool of choice for experienced financial analysts when
evaluating companies and their common stock. Many analysts prefer DCF methods of valuation because these
are based on a company’s cash flows, which are far less easily manipulated through accounting treatments
than revenues or bottom-line earnings.
The DCF model formula in its mathematical form is presented below:
where CF
1
is the estimated cash flow in year 1, CF
2
is the estimated cash flow in year 2, and so on; TCF is the
terminal cash flow, or expected cash flow from the ending asset sale;ris the discount rate or required rate of
return;gis the anticipated growth rate of the cash flow; andnis the number of years covered in the model.
Applying the DCF Model
We can apply the DCF model to an example to demonstrate this methodology and how the formula works.
Calculate the value of Mayweather Inc. and its common stock based on the next six years of cash flow results.
Assume that the discount rate (required rate of return) is 8%, Mayweather’s growth rate is 3%, and the
terminal value (TCF) will be two and one-half times the discounted value of the cash flow in year 6.
11.3 • Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model341

Mayweather has a cash flow of $2.0 million in year 1, so its discounted cash flow after one year (CF
1
) is
$1,851,851.85. We arrive at this amount by applying the discount rate of 8% for a one-year period to determine
the present value.
In subsequent years, Mayweather’s cash flow will be increasing by 3%. These future cash flows also must be
discounted back to present values at an 8% rate, so the discounted cash flow amounts over the next six years
will be as follows:
Our earlier assumption that the terminal value will be 2.5 times the value in the sixth year gives us a total
terminal cash flow (TCF) of, or $3,652,697. Now, if we take all these future discounted cash
flows and add them together, we arrive at a grand total of $13,554,477. So, based on our DCF model analysis,
the total value of Mayweather Inc. is just over $13.5 million.
At this point, we have the estimated value of the entire company, but we need to work this down to the level of
per-share value of common stock.
Let’s say that Mayweather is currently trading at $12 per share, and it has 1,000,000 common shares
outstanding. This tells us that the market capitalization of the company is, or $12 million,
and that a $12 share price may be considered relatively low. The reason for this is that based on our DCF
model analysis, investors would theoretically be willing to pay $13,554,477 divided by 1,000,000 shares, or
$13.55 per share, for Mayweather. The overall conclusion would be that at $12.00 per share, Mayweather
common stock would be a good buy at the present time.Figure 11.11shows the Excel spreadsheet approach
for arriving at the total value of Mayweather.

Advantages and Limitations of the DCF Model
Due to several corporate accounting scandals in recent years, many analysts have given increasing credence to
the use of cash flow as a metric for determining accurate corporate valuations. However, it should be noted
that cash flow is not always the best means of measuring financial health. A company can always sell a large
portion of its assets to generate a positive cash flow, even if it is operating at a loss or experiencing other
financial difficulties. Additionally, investors prefer to see companies reinvesting their cash back into their
businesses rather than sitting on excessive balances of idle cash.
Similar to other models, the discounted cash flow model is only as good as the information entered. As the
common expression goes, “garbage in, garbage out.” This can often be the case if reasonably accurate cash
flow estimates are not available or if an unrealistic discount rate or required rate of return is used in the
calculations. It is always best to use several different methods when valuing companies and their common
stock.

11.4Preferred Stock
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define preferred stock.
•Calculate the intrinsic value of preferred stock.
•Understand the difference between common stock and preferred stock.
Features of Preferred Stock
Preferred stockis a unique form of equity sold by some firms that offers preferential claims in ownership.
Preferred stock will often feature a dividend that a company is obligated to pay out before it makes any
dividend payments to common stockholders. In cases of bankruptcy and liquidation of the issuing company,
preferred stockholders have priority claim to assets before common stockholders. Additionally, preferred
stockholders are usually entitled to a set (or constant) dividend every period.
Preferred stock carries a stated par value, but unlike bonds, they have no maturity date, and consequently,
there is no final payment of the par value. The only time a company would pay this par value to the
shareholder would be if the company ceased operations or retired the preferred stock. Many preferred stock
issues are cumulative in nature, meaning that if a company skips or is otherwise unable to pay a cash dividend,
it becomes a liability to the company and must eventually be paid out to preferred shareholders at some point
in the future. Other preferred stocks may be noncumulative, in which case if the company skips dividends, they
are forever lost to the shareholder.
The termpreferredcomes from preferred shareholders receiving all past (if cumulative) and present dividends
before common shareholders receive any cash dividends. In other words, preferred shareholders’ dividend
claims are given preferential treatment over those of common shareholders. Preferred stock is usually a form
of permanent funding, but there are circumstances or covenants that could alter the payoff stream.
11.4 • Preferred Stock343

For example, a company may convert preferred stock into common stock at a preset point in the future. It is
not uncommon for companies to issue preferred stock that has a conversion feature. Such conversion features
give preferred shareholders the right to convert to common shares after a predetermined period.
A review of the characteristics of preferred stock will lead to the conclusion that the constant growth dividend
model is an excellent approach for valuing such stock. Because shares of preferred stock provide a constant
cash dividend based on original par value and the stated dividend rate, these may be considered a form of
perpetuity.
It is this constant, preferred dividend stream that makes preferred stock seem more like bonds or another
form of debt than like stock. In addition, the constant dividend stream leads nicely to the pricing of preferred
stock with the four dividend models we presented earlier in this chapter.
Determining the Intrinsic Value of Preferred Stock
We can apply a version of the present value of a perpetuity formula to value preferred stock, as in the
following example. Oh-Well Heath Services Inc. has issued preferred stock that has a par value of $1,000 and
pays an annual dividend rate of 5%. If the market considers the risk of Oh-Well to warrant a 10% discount rate,
what would be a fair market price for Oh-Well preferred stock?
First, we find the dividend value of Oh-Well:
We then use the constant dividend model with infinite horizon because we havegequal to zero andnequal to
infinity:
We can also rearrange the formula to determine the required return on this stock, given its annual dividend
and current price.
THINK IT THROUGH
Calculating the Return on Preferred Stock
Data Forge Inc. has just issued preferred stock (cumulative) with a par value of $100.00 and an annual
dividend rate of 7%. The preferred stock is currently selling for $35.00 per share. What is the yield or return
on this preferred stock?
Solution:
The first step is to determine the annual dividend by multiplying the dividend rate by the par value:
Now, using this $7.00 annual dividend, the $35.00 current price, and the equation above, we calculate the
rate of return as follows:

the preferred stockholder and the company’s cost of borrowing money for this particular type of capital.

11.5Efficient Markets
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Understand what is meant by the termefficient markets.
•Understand the termoperational efficiencywhen referring to markets.
•Understand the terminformational efficiencywhen referring to markets.
•Distinguish between strong, semi-strong, and weak levels of efficiency in markets.
Efficient Markets
For the public, the real concern when buying and selling of stock through the stock market is the question,
“How do I know if I’m getting the best available price for my transaction?” We might ask an even broader
question: Do these markets provide the best prices and the quickest possible execution of a trade? In other
words, we want to know whether markets are efficient. Byefficient markets, we mean markets in which costs
are minimal and prices are current and fair to all traders. To answer our questions, we will look at two forms of
efficiency: operational efficiency and informational efficiency.
Operational Efficiency
Operational efficiency concerns the speed and accuracy of processing a buy or sell order at the best available
price. Through the years, the competitive nature of the market has promoted operational efficiency.
In the past, theNYSE (New York Stock Exchange)used a designated-order turnaround computer system
known as SuperDOT to manage orders. SuperDOT was designed to match buyers and sellers and execute
trades with confirmation to both parties in a matter of seconds, giving both buyers and sellers the best
11.5 • Efficient Markets345

available prices. SuperDOT was replaced by a system known as theSuper Display Book (SDBK)in 2009 and
subsequently replaced by theUniversal Trading Platformin 2012.
NASDAQused a process referred to as the small-order execution system (SOES)to process orders. The
practice for registered dealers had been for SOES to publicly display all limit orders (orders awaiting execution
at specified price), the best dealer quotes, and the best customer limit order sizes. The SOES system has now
been largely phased out with the emergence of all-electronic trading that increased transaction speed at ever
higher trading volumes.
Public access to the best available prices promotes operational efficiency. This speed in matching buyers and
sellers at the best available price is strong evidence that the stock markets are operationally efficient.
Informational Efficiency
A second measure of efficiency is informational efficiency, or how quickly a source reflects comprehensive
information in the available trading prices. A price is efficient if the market has used all available information
to set it, which implies that stocks always trade at their fair value (seeFigure 11.12). If an investor does not
receive the most current information, the prices are “stale”; therefore, they are at a trading disadvantage.
Figure11.12Forms of Market EfficiencyA market is efficient if it provides all information that is available.
Forms of Market Efficiency
Financial economists have devised three forms of market efficiency from an information perspective: weak
form, semi-strong form, and strong form. These three forms constitute the efficient market hypothesis.
Believers in these three forms of efficient markets maintain, in varying degrees, that it is pointless to search
for undervalued stocks, sell stocks at inflated prices, or predict market trends.
In weak form efficient markets, current prices reflect the stock’s price history and trading volume. It is useless
to chart historical stock prices to predict future stock prices such that you can identify mispriced stocks and
routinely outperform the market. In other words, technical analysis cannot beat the market. The market itself
is the best technical analyst out there.

Summary
11.1Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation
This section introduced common stock and some of the models and calculation methods used by investors
and financial analysts to determine the prices or values of common shares. The most evaluative ratios that can
be computed from a company’s financial statements include the price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to book (P/B),
price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to cash-flow (P/CF) ratios.
11.2Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)
The dividend discount model, or DDM, is a method used to value a stock based on the concept that its worth is
the present value of all of its future dividends. The most common DDM is the Gordon growth model, which
values stock entirely on expected future dividends. Other techniques include the zero growth DDM, which
depends on fixed dividends; the constant growth DDM, which assumes that dividends will grow at a constant
rate; and the variable growth or nonconstant growth DDM, which is based on the assumption that stock value
will progress through different stages of growth. There is also the two-stage DDM, which is based on the
assumption of two stages of dividend growth: an initial period of higher growth and a subsequent period of
lower, more stable growth.
11.3Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model
Investors buy stock to receive cash inflows at different points in the future. These inflows may come in the
form of dividends or a final cash inflow. If the investor chooses to wait for a final cash flow, the hope is that
capital gains will be even stronger. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young
and do not pay dividends to their shareholders. The DCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows,
determining the present value of an entire organization using objective data and then working this down to
the share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.
11.4Preferred Stock
Preferred stock is a unique form of equity sold by some firms that offers preferential claims in ownership.
Preferred stock carries a stated par value, but unlike bonds, there is no maturity date, and consequently, there
is no final payment of the par value. The termpreferredcomes from preferred shareholders receiving all past
(if cumulative) and present dividends before common shareholders receive any cash dividends.
11.5Efficient Markets
Efficient markets are markets in which costs are minimal and prices are current and fair to all traders. There
are two forms of efficiency: operational efficiency and informational efficiency. Operational efficiency concerns
the speed and accuracy of processing a buy or sell order at the best available price. Informational efficiency
concerns how quickly a source reflects comprehensive information in the available trading prices. Financial
economists have devised three forms of efficient markets from an information perspective: weak form, semi-
strong form, and strong form.

Why It Matters
Author Mark Twain spoke for many when he wrote, “October—this is one of the peculiarly dangerous months
to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December,
August, and February.” Twain’s comment, though humorous, reflects the serious risks associated with
investing in the stock market. So why should we study the history of the US financial markets? Financial
experts regularly remind us that past performance is no guaranteeoffuture results. However, past
performance can provide targets or benchmarks around which to build expectations. We can learn about the
past to prepare for future possibilities, or we can suffer what Winston Churchill warned, “Those that fail to
learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”
Carlos SlimHelu, a Mexican businessman and the richest person in the world from 2010 to 2013, once said,
“With a good perspective on history, we can have a better understanding of the past and present, and thus a
clear vision of the future.”

In this chapter, we examine current and historical performance in money, bond,
and stock markets. Studying past market risk and return also allows investors to understand what is
reasonable and what is not.

12.1Overview of US Financial Markets
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Identify the various aspects of the US money markets.
•Characterize government and corporate bond markets.
•Detail the structure and operations of US equity markets.
Money Markets
The money market is a multitrillion-dollar market. Features of money market securities include being short-
term (with maturities of less than one year) and very low risk (rarely failing to make their required payments).
Further, money market securities are also liquid, which means that they trade easily without losing value.
Financial institutions, corporations, and governments that have short-term borrowing and/or lending needs
issue securities in the money market. Most of the transactions are quite large, with typical amounts of $10,000,
$100,000, $1 million, or more. Money market securities are available in smaller amounts if you choose to invest
inmoney market mutual funds (MMMFs)or certain types ofexchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Treasury bills (T-bills)are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are
auctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of theFederal Reserve Bank of
New York, with maturities of 4, 8, 13, or 26 weeks. The Treasury also auctions 52-week T-bills once every four
weeks. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short
maturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local
income taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt
securities.
The volume of T-bills auctioned depends upon government borrowing needs. Much of the money raised at
weekly T-bill auctions goes to repay the money borrowed 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks earlier. The gross amount of
new T-bills issued in December 2020 was $1,591.1 billion, and the amount of T-bills retired in the same month
was $1,570.6 billion, resulting in net new borrowing of “only” $20.5 billion.
In addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can
trade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills has exceeded
$75 billion.
Commercial paper (CP)is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial
institutions to meet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables. For example, credit card
companies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper is a short-term debt
instrument, with a typical maturity of 30 days and up to 270 days. The short maturity reducesUS Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC)oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP means that only
highly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper.
Commercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount, with the face
value as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue CP; thus,
returns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for CP. Most purchasers are
large, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial paper until maturity. The
default rate on commercial paper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range
during the financial crisis of 2008.
Negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs)are very largeCDsissued by financial institutions. They are
redeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.
NCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical
amounts are $1 million, with a maturity of two weeks to six months.

NCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or
credit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and has FDIC insurance.
However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the
issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount, but it is much larger than a regular
CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to cash out
early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher rates on
NCDs compared to CDs because it knows it will have use of the purchase amount for the entire maturity of the
NCD and because the reserve requirements on NCDs by theFederal Reserveis lower than for other types of
deposits.
Investment companies such asVanguardandFidelity, among many others, sell shares in money market
mutual funds (MMMFs). The investment company purchases money market instruments, such as T-bills, CP, or
NCDs; pools them; and then sells shares of ownership to investors (seeTable 12.1). Generally, MMMFs invest
only in taxable securities, such as commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit, or only in tax-
exempt government securities, such as T-bills. Investors can then choose which type of short-term liquid
securities they would like to hold, taxable or nontaxable. MMMFs provide smaller firms and investors the
opportunity to participate in the money market by facilitating smaller individual investment amounts.

Table12.1Money Market Instrument Characteristics (Selected)
The market forfederal fundsis notable because theFederal Reserve(Fed) targets the equilibrium interest rate
on federal funds as one of its most important monetary policy tools. The federal funds market traditionally
consists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial
institutions, notably domestic commercial banks. Financial institutions such as banks are required to keep a
fraction of their deposits on reserve with the Fed. When banks find they are short of reserves and immediately
need cash to meet reserve requirements, they can borrow directly from the Fed through the so-called
“discount window” or purchase excess reserves from other banks in the federal funds market. Often, the
maturity of a federal funds contract is as short as a single day or overnight. The participants in the market
negotiate the federal funds interest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate
range in the federal funds market by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market.
Since thefinancial crisis of 2008, the activities and functioning of the federal funds market has changed. The
federal funds rate is still the rate targeted by the Fed for monetary policy, but the participants have evolved for
several reasons. The market now includes foreign banks and non-depository financial institutions, such as the
Federal Home Loan Banks. These institutions do not need to meet Fed reserve requirements and are not
required to keep reserves with the Fed. In addition, the Fed now pays interest to commercial banks for
reserves held at the Federal Reserve banks. Paying interest on reserves reduces the incentive for domestic
commercial banks to enter the federal funds market since they can already earn interest on their excess
reserves.
12.1 • Overview of US Financial Markets355

Daily trading volume in the federal funds market from 2016 through 2020 ranged from a high of $115 billion in
March of 2018 to a low of only $34 billion on December 31, 2020.
2
The volume of federal funds activity is lower
in periods of slower economic growth because banks have fewer good opportunities to issue loans and are
less likely to be short of required reserves.
Bond Markets
Bond markets are financial markets that make payments to investors for a specific period of time. Investors
decide how much to pay for a bond depending on how much they expectinflationto affect the value of the
fixed payment. There are several types of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds.
Government Bond Markets
In the section on money markets, we discussed T-bills, and we now discuss longer-term government securities
in the form of Treasury notes and Treasury bonds.
We learned inBonds and Bond Valuationthat the federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to
raise money for current spending and to repay past borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large,
as the US federal government over the years has accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion dollars.
The debt has grown so large we even have a real-time debt calculator online athttps://www.usdebtclock.org/
(https://openstax.org/r/usdebtclock).
Treasury notes (T-notes)are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. The
Treasury auctions notes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes fromTreasuryDirect.gov
(https://openstax.org/r/treasurydirect.gov)in the same way they would a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in
that they are longer term and pay semiannual coupon interest payments, as well as the par or face value of
the note at maturity. T-bills, as you will recall, sell at a discount and pay the face value at maturity with no
explicit interest payments. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed.
However, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally
exempt from state and local taxes.
Economists and investors keep a close eye on the 10-year T-note for several reasons. Mortgage lenders use it
as a basis for setting and adjusting mortgage interest rates. In general, the rate on the 10-year T-note is a
reliable market indicator of investor confidence.
There is an active secondary market for Treasury notes. From 2001 to 2020, the daily trading volume for
Treasury notes has averaged $395 billion, or roughly five times the daily trading volume of T-bills. Treasury
notes are the largest single type of government debt instrument, with over $11 trillion outstanding. As you can
see fromFigure 12.2, the Treasury dramatically increased borrowing by issuing notes following the 2008
financial crisis.
Brokers, dealers, and investment companies provide secondary market opportunities for individual and
institutional investors.Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)are popular investment vehicles for many types of
government T-bill, T-note, and T-bond portfolios. An ETF is a basket of securities that can trade like stocks on a
stock exchange. For example,IEIis an iShares ETF managed byBlackRockthat invests in Treasury securities
with three to seven years to maturity. When investors buy this ETF, they purchase a small bundle of Treasury
notes that they can buy or sell, just as if they owned an individual share of stock. ETFs are a convenient way for
investors to own broad portfolios of securities while still being able to trade the whole group in a single
transaction if they choose.

Figure12.2Daily Trading Volume for US Treasury Notes and Bonds(data source: treasurydirect.gov)
Longer-term Treasury issues,Treasury bonds, have maturities of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds are like T-notes in
that they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at
maturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates. T-bonds with maturities of
20 and 30 years are each auctioned only once per month. At the end of 2020, there were approximately $2.8
trillion of T-bonds outstanding, compared to approximately $11.1 trillion and $5 trillion of T-notes and T-bills.
In 1997, the Treasury began offering a new type of longer-term debt instrument,Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities, or TIPS. TIPS currently have maturities of 5, 10, or 30 years and are auctioned by the Treasury once
per month. Like T-notes and T-bonds, they offer semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the
security and pay face value at maturity. The coupon interest rates are fixed, but the principal value adjusts
monthly in response to changes in theconsumer price index (CPI). Inflation and deflation cause the value of
the principal to increase or decrease, which results in a larger or smaller semiannual coupon payment. With a
total outstanding value of approximately $1.6 trillion at the end of 2020, TIPS are the smallest form of Treasury
borrowing we have discussed.
3
State and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form ofmunicipal bonds (munis). Local
borrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is atypical but possible. Thus,
munis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to corporate bonds in that they receive a bond rating based on
the perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest payments are tax-
free. Interest on munis (municipal bonds) is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from
state and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.
There are two primary types of municipal bonds:revenue bondsandgeneral obligation (GO) bonds. GO bonds
generate cash flows to repay the bonds by taxing a project. For instance, a local school district may tax
residents to pay for capital construction, or a city may tax citizens to pay for a new public works building.
Revenue bonds, on the other hand, may apply to projects that generate sufficient cash flows to repay the
bond—perhaps a utility or local toll road.
Corporate Bond Markets
Just as governments borrow money in the long-term from investors, so do corporations. A corporation often
uses bank loans, commercial paper, or supplier credit for short-term borrowing needs and issues bonds for
longer-term financing. Bond contracts identify very specific terms of agreement and outline the rules for the
order, timing, and amount of contractual payments, as well as processes for when one or more of the required
activities lapse.Indentureis the legal term for a bond contract. The indenture also includes limitations on the

corporation for how they may use the bond proceeds.
A bond indenture includes both standard boilerplate contract language and specific conditions unique to a
particular issue. Because of these non-standardized features of a bond contract, the secondary market for
trading used bonds typically requires a broker, dealer, or investment company to facilitate a trade.
When a corporation uses a real asset, such as property or buildings, to guarantee a bond, the firm has issued a
mortgage bond. However, it is more common for a corporation to issue an unsecured bond known as a
debenture. The risk of a debenture reflects the risk of the entire corporation and does not rely on the value of
a specific underlying asset, as is the case with a mortgage bond.
The risk a bondholder bears for buying a bond depends in part on the terms of the bond indenture, market
conditions over the life of the bond contract, and the ability or inability of the firm to generate sufficient cash
flows to meet its bond obligations. Fortunately, investors do not have to make these determinations about risk
on their own. They can rely on bond rating services such asMoody’s,Standard and Poor’s, orFitchto generate
evaluations of the creditworthiness of bond issuers.
Ratings firms must adhere to rigorous standards when evaluating client creditworthiness. For example,
Standard and Poor’s begins the explanation of its evaluation process with these paragraphs:
“S&P Global Ratingsprovides a Credit Rating only when, in its opinion, there is information of satisfactory
quality to form a credible opinion on creditworthiness, consistent with its Quality of the Rating Process –
Sufficient Information (Quality of Information) Policy, and only after applicable quantitative, qualitative, and
legal analyses are performed. Throughout the ratings and surveillance process, the analytical team reviews
information from both public and nonpublic sources.”
“For corporate, government, and financial services company or entity (collectively referred to as“C&G” Credit
Ratings), the analysis generally includes historical and projected financial information, industry and/or
economic data, peer comparisons, and details on planned financings. In addition, the analysis is based on
qualitative factors, such as the institutional or governance framework, the financial strategy of the rated entity
and, generally, the experience and credibility of management.”
4
Table 12.2is a summary of how the three major credit rating agencies identify their ratings. Bond ratings are
important for many reasons. The higher a firm’s rating, the lower the expected default risk and the lower the
cost of borrowing for the firm. Pension funds may be restricted to investing in only medium- or higher-grade
bonds. This could limit the number of investors who can participate in the market for lower-grade bonds,
thereby reducing the liquidity, price, and tradability of those debt securities.
There are only two US companies with AAA credit ratings:MicrosoftandJohnson & Johnson.
5
Over the past 40
years, there has been a steady decline of AAA-rated companies (from sixty in 1980). Many institutions have
found that this rating requires a more conservative approach to debt that can inhibit growth and revenue. So,
in today’s market, credit ratings have begun to lose their importance. It seems that the ability to pay debts has
become secondary to the potential for growth.

Equity Markets
An important goal of firm managers is to maximize owners’ wealth. For corporations, shares of stock
represent ownership. A corporation could have 100 shares, one million shares, or even several billion shares of
stock. Stocks are difficult to value compared to bonds. Bonds typically provide periodic interest payments and
a principal payment at maturity. The bond indenture specifies the timing and the amount of payments. Stocks
might have periodic dividend payments, and an investor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future.
However, no contract guarantees the size of the dividends or the time and resale price of the stock. Thus, the
cash flows from stock ownership are more uncertain and risky.
Corporations are the dominant form of business enterprise in the United States because of the ability to raise
capital, the ease of transfer of ownership, and the benefit of limited liability to the owners. There are generally
two types of stock, preferred and common. Preferred stock is a hybrid between common stock and bonds.
Preferred stock has a higher claim to cash flows than common stockholders have (thus the termpreferred),
but it is lower than that of bondholders. In addition, preferred stock has fixed cash flows as bonds have and
typically has no or few voting rights. Preferred stock dividends are after-tax payments by the corporation, as
are common stock dividends, but bond interest payments, paid prior to taxes, are tax-deductible for firms. Of
the three, preferred stock is the least used form of capital financing for corporations.
Common stockholders are the residual claimants and owners of the corporation. After all others who have a
claim against the firm are paid, the common stockholders own all that remains. Common stockholders have
voting rights, typically one vote per share, and choose the board of directors.
One popular way to rank the size of companies is to determine the value of their market capitalization, or
market cap. Market cap is equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.
According to theWorld Bank, the total market cap of US firms at the end of 2020 was $50.8 trillion, making up
over half of the world’s total value of equity, estimated at $90 trillion.

Geographical Location of Exchanges
Ownership is easily transferable for stocks that trade in one of the organized stock exchanges or in anover-
the-counter (OTC) market. Definitions of a stock exchange and an OTC market blur as financial markets quickly
adapt to innovations. However, stock markets have a centralized trading location, transactions require a
broker to connect buyers and sellers, and the exchanges guarantee a basic level of liquidity so that investors
are always able to buy or sell their stocks. An OTC market is an electronic market conducted on computer
screens and consists of direct transactions among buyers and sellers, with no broker to bring the two

together. Because there is no formal exchange present, it is possible that investors will have trouble finding
buyers or sellers for their stocks.
Most of the trading consists of used or previously issued stocks in over-the-counter markets and organized
exchanges. The two largest stock exchanges in the world, as measured by the market capitalization of the
companies listed on the exchange, are theNew York Stock Exchange (NYSE)and theNASDAQ. Both exchanges
are located in the United States. Other large stock exchanges are located in Japan, China, Hong Kong,
continental Europe, London, and Saudi Arabia.
Process of Offering Equities
Theprimary marketis the market for new securities, and thesecondary marketis the market for used
securities. When issuing new equity, the issuing firm receives the proceeds of the sale. Having an active
secondary market makes it easier for corporations to issue stock, as investors know they can resell if desired.
Most of the trading of equity securities is for used securities on the secondary market.
Aninitial public offering, or IPO, occurs when a firm offers stock to the public for the first time. With a typical
IPO, a private company decides to raise capital and go public with the help of an investment banker. The
investment banker agrees to provide financial advice, recommend the price and number of shares to issue,
and establish a syndicate of underwriters to finance and ultimately distribute the new shares to investors (see
Figure 12.3). An IPO is expensive for the issuing firm, and it can expect to incur costs of 5% to 8% or more of
the value of the IPO. As of the end of 2020, the largest successful IPO belongs to Saudi Aramco, a petroleum
company, valued at $25.6 billion at issue in December 2019.
8
The Ant Group had planned an IPO valued at
over $34 billion dollars in 2020, but as of the end of 2020 that issue was put on hold by the Chinese
government.
9
Institutional and preferred individual investors are typically the initial purchasers of IPOs. Smaller investors
rarely have the opportunity to purchase. However, any investor can buy the new shares once available for
public trading. Investment author and financial expert Professor BurtonMalkielcautions that buying IPOs
immediately after issue can be a money-losing investment. He cites research showing that, historically, IPOs
have underperformed the market by an average of 4% per year.
10
Another way for a corporation to raise capital in the equity market is through aseasoned equity offering
(SEO). An IPO occurs when a firm transitions from a private to a public company. An SEO takes place when a
corporation that is already publicly traded issues additional shares of stock to the public. An SEO is often part
of a SEC Rule 415 offering, or so-calledshelf registration. Shelf registrations allow a company to register with
the SEC to issue new shares but wait up to two years before issuing the shares. This gives companies the
ability to register their intent to issue new shares and to “set them on the shelf” until market conditions are
most favorable for issuance to the public.

Figure12.3The IPO Process
Alternative Methods of Raising Capital
Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)were born in the 1990s and came of age in 2019.
11
SPACs
are a special form of IPO. We know that firms with products or services to sell and a documented operational
and financial history often initiate an IPO to raise money by going public. A SPAC, however, is like an IPO that
puts the cart before the horse. By this, we mean that rather than having a company ready to go public to raise
capital, with a SPAC, a sponsor raises capital in anticipation of finding a firm ready to go public. This is why we
sometimes refer to SPACs as “blank check” companies. Investors are providing capital to a firm that has no
assets with the expectation that the sponsor will find a good investment.
Forming a SPAC shifts the risk and expenses associated with a firm going public. Because the money raised by
the SPAC sponsor is the only asset, the process of filing with the SEC is less complicated, less expensive, and
less time-consuming than filing an IPO. Often, when formed, a SPAC has a target company in mind, but this is
not a requirement. Once the SPAC identifies a target firm, the sponsor can negotiate a purchase price and
essentially merge with the target. Underpricing of IPOs is well documented,
12
and the owners of a private
company going public do not capture the significant increase in stock price that frequently occurs in the
months following an IPO.
A SPAC offering allows the private firm owners to negotiate for a better price. A July 2020 study from
Renaissance Capitalreports that “of 223 SPAC IPOs conducted from the start of 2015 through July 2020, 89
have completed mergers and taken a company public.” According to the study, of those 89 mergers, “the
common shares have delivered an average loss of 18.8% and a median return of minus 36.1%. That compares
with the average after-market return from traditional IPOs of 37.2%” over the same time period.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define inflation with concrete examples.
•Describe the practical impact of inflation on consumption and salary.
•Explain how expected and actual inflation are measured.
•Detail the behavior of inflation over various historical periods.
Over time, returns in the stock market have easily outperformed returns in the bond market. However, not
everyone is comfortable investing in stocks. Taking a more informed and opposing view, financial economist
JeremySiegelqueries, “You have never lost money in stocks over any 20-year period, but you have wiped out
half your portfolio in bonds (after inflation). So which is the riskier asset?”
14
Siegel brings up a valid point
about inflation. Returns adjusted for changes in prices provide a better measure of value or wealth. Baseball
pundit Sam Ewing noted, “Inflation is when you pay fifteen dollars for the ten-dollar haircut you used to get
for five dollars when you had hair.”
15
If what you have earned on your investments fails to keep up with
changing prices, you may have a larger portfolio with less purchasing power.
Expected versus Actual Inflation
Inflation occurs when things cost more and your money buys less today than it did yesterday. It is
understandable to dislike inflation and to be concerned over the prospect of rising prices. In fact, two of the
primary policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to work for price stability and moderate interest rates.
However, is inflation necessarily good or bad? In practice, inflation can benefit some people and harm others
at the same time. Consider the impact of differences in expected and actual realized inflation. Empirical
evidence suggests that, on average, economists do a good job of developing inflation rate forecasts that
match the actual rate of inflation. Estimated inflation is built into the interest rates investors require or are
willing to pay for financial products, such as fixed-rate loans or bonds. When the actual rate of inflation
exceeds the estimated rate on a product, such as a mortgage loan, this means borrowers are repaying the
loan with less-valuable dollars and benefit from the increased inflation rate. Lenders, however, receive those
inflation-impacted dollars and are harmed due to their unexpected decrease in purchasing power.
Deflation, or falling prices, is associated with economic recessions or even depressions and is thought to be an
even more serious problem than inflation. Generally, policy makers tend to support moderate inflation, being
careful to stay away from zero or negative price changes.

Inflation Impacts
Ultimately, inflation redistributes wealth. Lenders providing fixed-rate loans receive less-valuable dollars in
return. Borrowers repay with those same less-valuable dollars. Workers receive less-valuable dollars, especially
when their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven
economy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However,
too much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage
increases. Higher inflation raises the rates on new borrowing instruments and can slow the rate of business
investment and economic growth. Inflation raises overall prices and may cause hardship for consumers on a
fixed income.
Finally, inflation does not have an equal impact on all goods and services. AsTable 12.3shows, consumer
prices did not increase at the same rate for the selected items shown. From 1980 to 2020, inflation, as
measured by theconsumer price index (CPI), grew at an average annual rate of 2.90%. However, the price of
college tuition and fees increased at more than double that rate. Rent, another large expense for most college
students, increased at an annual rate of 3.67%, also well above the average increase in the CPI. The price
increases for ground beef and butter were slightly less than the CPI average. For the selected items presented
here, only the average price for used cars and trucks rose at a rate significantly lower than the average rate of
inflation.

Table12.3Changing Consumer Price Levels—Selected Goods(source:
US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price Index)
Using Graphs and Charts to Plot Inflation Behavior
The CPI is a measure of how prices have changed for a basket of goods across the United States.Figure 12.5
shows the eight major categories of expenditures included in the CPI.
16
Different regions of the country and
population subgroups may experience different rates of inflation. Retired people may spend a greater portion
of their income on healthcare than someone in their twenties.
17
Residents on the East and West Coasts spend
a higher percentage of their earnings on housing than those living in the Midwest.
18
As such, there are several
different measures of inflation based on geographic region or other factors.
19
It is worth noting that a basket
of goods and services that cost $100 in 1984 would cost approximately $260 by the end of 2020, an increase of
160% (seeFigure 12.6)! Over that same period, the average annual rate of inflation as measured by the CPI
was 2.55%. These numbers make it easy to see that even a relatively modest annual inflation rate, lower than
the long-run annual US inflation rate of 3%, results in significant price increases.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Profile of Janet Yellen
Figure12.7Janet Yellen(credit: “Janet Yellen Official Federal Reserve Portrait.” United States Federal Reserve/Wikimedia
Commons, Public Domain)
JanetYellenhas led a life of firsts. After graduating as valedictorian of her high school class, Yellen later
attended Yale University and was the only woman in her 1971 PhD graduating class in economics. Men have
long dominated the “dismal science” of economics, but Yellen has proved to be an exception.
Motivated by an undergraduate economics professor at Pembroke College of Brown University, Yellen
realized how much the US central bank, known as the Federal Reserve, could influence the lives of ordinary
people. She changed her major to economics, and the rest, as they say, is history.
In her first stint working with the Federal Reserve in 1977, Yellen met and married George Ackerlof. Ackerlof
would go on to win a Nobel Prize in Economics. Ackerlof and Yellen eventually established themselves as
faculty members at the University of California, Berkeley. Yellen was twice named Outstanding Teacher in
the Haas School of Business and was recognized for her award-winning research.
In 1993, Yellen began her second tour at the Federal Reserve as an appointed member of the Board of
Governors. She left this position in 1997 to head President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. Yellen
became just the second woman to head the presidential council.
She then returned to California and the Bay Area, eventually becoming president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010. Later that year she became the vice chair of the Federal Reserve.
Four years later, in 2014, Yellen assumed leadership as the first woman chair of the Federal Reserve System.
As Fed chair, Yellen earned an enviable record. During her four-year tenure, the rate of unemployment
decreased by more than 2.5%, and employment increased in every month of her term. This is the first and
only time in the history of the Federal Reserve that the board chair has overseen continuous increases in
12.2 • Historical Picture of Inflation365

employment over their entire tenure.
Now, another first: In 2021, President Joe Biden appointed Yellen as the first woman Secretary of the
Treasury. Yellen has a storied career and a long list of accomplishments, but surely her record of firsts will
prove to be an important and lasting legacy for women in business, government, and economics
everywhere.

Federal Government Bond Behavior, Discussion, Charts, and Graphs
United States Treasury (sovereign) bonds are among the safest investments available. In fact, T-bonds often
serve as the proxy for a risk-free investment in financial modeling. However, even though T-bonds may be
essentially default-risk free, they do change value as interest rates change. Look atFigure 12.8, showing
annual T-bond returns from 1980 to 1999. None of these bonds defaulted, yet investors realized very different
returns on their investments from year to year. Thetotal returnsreflect interest payments plus the change in
price because of changes in interest rates.
The late 1970s experienced high rates of inflation and interest rates. As those rates began to fall in late 1981,
bond prices rose. Investors holding T-bond portfolios realized very large returns on their risk-free investments
in 1982. That year provided the highest annual return in the 20-year period, with an annual return of 32.81%.
The lowest annual return was in 1999, as the Federal Reserve began to raise rates to temper an overheating
stock market caused by dot-com speculation gaining momentum. When the Fed raised interest rates, the
prices on existing bonds fell, and investors realized a -8.25% return on their bond portfolios. Thus, the range in
returns on these “low risk” investment securities was over 41% from the highest to the lowest annual return in
this particular two-decade span. Overall, the average annual return on T-bonds from 1980 to 1999 was a robust
10.21%, boosted in part by the above average annual inflation rate of 4.28%.

Figure12.8Treasury Bond Performance, 1980–1999(data source: AswathDamodaranOnline)
Inflation slowed from 2000 to 2020, and the average annual rate of return on T-bonds fell accordingly (see
Figure 12.9). With reduced variability of interest rates in the new century and interest rates in general being
lower, the returns on bond portfolios were also lower on average. T-bonds in the first two decades of the
twenty-first century averaged an annual return of 5.77%, very close to the long-run average return in the
previous century. The range of returns was also smaller than the previous two decades, with the highest
annual return topping out at 20.10% in 2008 and the lower end dipping down to -11.12% in 2009 as the Fed
made a significant effort to reduce interest rates in an attempt to stimulate the economy following theGreat
Recession.
Corporate Bond Behavior, Discussion, Charts, and Graphs
The performance of Baa bonds is very similar to T-Bonds over the four decades spanning 1980 to 2020 (see
Figure 12.10). These bonds are not default-risk free and require a risk premium for investors. The average
annual return of 12.07% from 1980 to 1999 topped T-bonds by 1.86%. The margin was greater in the period
from 2000 to 2020 (seeFigure 12.11), with Baa bonds (mid-tier corporate bonds) realizing an average annual
premium of 2.30% over the default-risk free T-bonds.
These premiums translate to a substantial increase in investment performance. For example, had an investor
placed $100 into a T-bond portfolio in 1980, the value of the investment would have been $1,931 by year-end
2020. This would have easily outpaced the rate of inflation but significantly lagged the ending value of $4,506
on a similar Baa bond portfolio investment (seeFigure 12.12).

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Profile of Bill Gross
BillGrossmay be the most successful fixed-income investor ever, but he is also a prime example of the
application of the efficient market theory. In over 40 years of investing in bonds and other types of fixed-
income securities worldwide, Bill Gross earned his moniker “the bond king.”
In 1971, Gross cofounded and began his long tenure as managing director and chief investment officer of
Pacific Investment Management Company, better known as Pimco. Gross was not yet 30 years old, but he
had already graduated from college, served in the Navy in Vietnam, and even briefly worked as a
professional blackjack player in Las Vegas to bankroll the cost of his MBA from UCLA.
Gross helped change the definition of success for bond investors by focusing on total returns, including
price changes, rather than simply bond yields. He used mathematical modeling and invested worldwide
and in different types of bond markets seeking risk-adjusted returns. Gross made active rather than passive
management of bond funds a successful investment strategy. In the process, he changed how mangers
oversee fixed-income portfolios today.
Pimco grew into an investment powerhouse under Gross’s direction, eventually managing over $1.5 trillion
dollars in assets. During the financial crisis of 2008, Gross served as an adviser to the US Treasury.
Morningstar named him “fixed income fund manager of the decade” in 2010. In addition, Gross profited
from his investment prowess, amassing a fortune in excess of $2 billion.
Gross’s investment strategy was to carefully analyze the known factors about debt instruments and pair
that analysis with the unknown future. He was uncanny in his ability to estimate future prices, interest
rates, and macroeconomic conditions to make profitable investments.
However, as efficient markets would posit, the odds began to catch up with Gross in the latter part of his
investing career. After leaving Pimco in 2014, Gross was unable to match his earlier performance successes
and failed to beat bond fund performance averages. Much of Gross’s investment strategy allowed him to
look forbond returnsby investing in any type of bond, with any maturity, in any country, and in any
location. For decades, he was right more often than wrong in his investment choices. However, statistically,
12.3 • Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds369

his approach to investing suggested that, unless he could see the future, at some point his expectations
would be incorrect. Perhaps Gross’s greatest competition comes from a generation of investment
managers who learned and improved upon his proven strategies. He retired as an active public fund
manager in 2019.
Today, Gross continues to manage his personal fortune, as well as the assets in his family charitable
foundation. Gross and the foundation have donated over $800 million to several causes over the last two
decades. In 2020, Gross joined BillGates, WarrenBuffett, and hundreds of other billionaires in signing the
Giving Pledge, whose signees promise to donate over 50% of their wealth during their lifetime and/or upon
their death.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain overall equity market behavior over various historical periods.
•Explain different equity style and size behavior over various historical periods.
•Extract various equity market performance results from plots and charts.
Using Graphs and Charts to Plot Equity Market Behavior Stock Size Considerations
TheDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), also known as theDow 30) and the S&P 500 Index are the most
frequently quoted stock market indices among scholars, businesses, and the public in general. Both indices
track the change in value of a group of large capitalization stocks. The changes in the two indices are highly
correlated.
It may be fair to question if either index is a good representation of the value of equity and the changes in
value in the market because there are over 6,000 publicly traded companies listed on organized exchanges
and thousands of additional companies that trade only over the counter. As of year-end 2020, the S&P 500
firms had a combined market capitalization of $33.4 trillion, about 66% of the estimated US equity market
capitalization of $50.8 trillion.
20
It is widely agreed that the performance of the S&P 500 is a good
representation of the broader market and more specifically of large capitalization firms.
Figure 12.13provides a visualization of how S&P 500stock returnshave stacked up since 1900. This figure
makes it clear that equity returns roughly follow a bell curve, or normal distribution. Thus, we are able to
measure risk with standard deviation. A lower standard deviation of returns suggests less uncertainty of
returns and therefore less risk.
Capital market history demonstrates that the average return to stocks has significantly outperformed other
financial security classes, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, or the money market.Table 12.4
provides the return and standard deviation of several US investment classes over the 40-year period
1981–2020. As you can see, stocks outperformed bonds, bills, and inflation. This has led many investment
advisers to emphasize asset allocation first and individual security selection second. The intuition is that the

decision to invest in stocks rather than bonds has a greater long-run payoff than the change in performance
resulting from the selection of any individual or group of stocks.
Figure 12.14demonstrates the growth of a $100 investment at the start of 1928. Note that the value of the
large company portfolio is more than 50 times greater than the equal investment in long-term US government
bonds. This supports the importance of thoughtful asset allocation.
Still, the size of a firm has a significant impact on how investors choose equity securities. Capital market
history also shows that a portfolio of small company stocks has realized larger average annual returns, as well
as greater variability, than a portfolio of large companies as represented by the S&P 500. Small-cap stock total
returns ranged from a high of 142.9% in 1933 to a low of -58.0% in 1937.
More recently, the differential return between small and large capital stocks has not been as pronounced.
From 1980 through 2020, theWilshire US Small-Cap Indexhas averaged an annual compound return of 12.13%
compared to the Wilshire US Large Cap Index average of 11.82% over the same period. The 31-basis point
premium is much smaller than that realized in the 1926–2019 period, which saw a small-cap average annual
compounded return of 11.90% versus 10.14% for the large-cap portfolio.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Warren Buffett
Figure12.15WarrenBuffett(credit: “Warren Buffet at the 2015 Select USA Investment Summit.” USA International Trade
Administration/Wikimedia Commons, CC Public Domain Mark)
Warren Buffett has not always been one of the richest people in the world, but he has always been one of
the hardest workers. An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he
“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of
dollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining
pinball machines in barbershops.
As they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of
hay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in
the world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.
The “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most
notably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder ofBerkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire
Hathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying
shares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the
company and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business
away from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total
ownership of the Geico Insurance Company.
Buffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his
current and future plans. Buffett followed the method of BenjaminGraham, famous value investor and
author ofSecurity Analysis,The IntelligentInvestor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis
12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks373

of financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied
the same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire
people. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t
have the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want
them lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do
you discover who’s been swimming naked.”
Buffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies. When asked repeatedly
about how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you
can’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the
stock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding
earnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When
asked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer
than the windshield.”
Buffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in
the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock
for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”
The third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and
MelindaGates, Buffett started theGiving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200
billionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes. Buffett states, “If
you’re in the luckiest 1% of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99%.”
Buffett has begun the process to give away most of his fortune, but he has left this pearl of wisdom for his
own children: “A very rich person should leave his kids enough to do anything, but not enough to do
nothing.”

Summary
12.1Overview of US Financial Markets
One way to parse financial markets is by the maturity of financial instruments. With this dichotomy, we
explored the money market and the capital market. The money market consists of short-term securities and
the capital market of longer-term securities. The capital market discussion focused on debt and equity as
financial instruments used to finance longer-term capital financing needs. IPOs or SPACs are vehicles for
raising new equity. Most trading on organized exchanges or over-the-counter markets is for used, or
secondary, securities.
12.2Historical Picture of Inflation
The Federal Reserve considers moderate inflation rates optimal in their oversight of the US economy. We
measure inflation by comparing the price of a bundle or basket of goods over time and documenting how
prices change. Since not everyone consumes similar baskets of goods, we calculate several different measures
of inflation. The most commonly quoted measure of inflation uses changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
12.3Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds
Historical bond yields are published going back hundreds of years but are only reliably available for the last
100 years or so. In large part, the returns realized on portfolios of bonds have been smaller and less variable
than the returns realized for equities.
12.4Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks
Stocks have produced the greatest average annual rates of return of the money and capital market assets
discussed in this chapter. Stockholders bear more risk than bondholders or money market investors and
receive on average higher average annual returns. Despite the relatively high average annual rate of return for
portfolios of stock, history shows that the equity markets earn negative annual returns about 25% of the time.
The negative returns realized by equities occur far more often than the negative results realized by money
market or debt market instruments.

Why It Matters
Statistical analysis is used extensively in finance, with applications ranging from consumer concerns such as
credit scores, retirement planning, and insurance to business concerns such as assessing stock market
volatility and predicting inflation rates. As a consumer, you will make many financial decisions throughout your
life, and many of these decisions will be guided by statistical analysis. For example, what is the probability that
interest rates will rise over the next year, and how will that affect your decision on whether to refinance a
mortgage? In your retirement planning, how should the investment mix be allocated among stocks and bonds
to minimize volatility and ensure a high probability for a secure retirement? When running a business, how
can statistical quality control methods be used to maintain high quality levels and minimize waste? Should a
business make use of consumer focus groups or customer surveys to obtain business intelligence data to
improve service levels? These questions and more can benefit from the use and application of statistical
methods.
Running a business and tracking its finances is a complex process. From day-to-day activities such as
managing inventory levels to longer-range activities such as developing new products or expanding a
customer base, statistical methods are a key to business success. For finance considerations, a business must
manage risk versus return and optimize investments to ensure shareholder value. Business managers employ
a wide range of statistical processes and tools to accomplish these goals. Increasingly, companies are also

interested in data analytics to optimize the value gleaned from business- and consumer-related data, and
statistical analysis forms the core of such analytics.
13.1Measures of Center
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate various measures of the average of a data set, such as mean, median, mode, and geometric
mean.
•Recognize when a certain measure of center is more appropriate to use, such as weighted mean.
•Distinguish among arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and weighted mean.
Arithmetic Mean
Theaverageof a data set is a way of describing location. The most widely used measures of thecenterof a
data set are the mean (average), median, and mode. The arithmetic mean is the most common measure of the
average. We will discuss the geometric mean later.
Note that the wordsmeanandaverageare often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the
other is common practice. The technical term isarithmetic mean, andaveragetechnically refers only to a
center location. Formally, the arithmetic mean is called the first moment of the distribution by
mathematicians. However, in practice among non-statisticians,averageis commonly accepted as a synonym
forarithmetic mean.
To calculate thearithmetic meanvalue of 50 stock portfolios, add the 50 portfolio dollar values together and
divide the sum by 50. To calculate the arithmetic mean for a set of numbers, add the numbers together and
then divide by the number of data values.
In statistical analysis, you will encounter two types of data sets:sample dataandpopulation data. Population
data represents all the outcomes or measurements that are of interest. Sample data represents outcomes or
measurements collected from a subset, or part, of the population of interest.
The notationis used to indicate the sample mean, where the arithmetic mean is calculated based on data
taken from a sample. The notationis used to denote the sum of the data values, andis used to indicate
the number of data values in the sample, also known as the sample size.
The sample mean can be calculated using the following formula:
Finance professionals often rely on averages of Treasury bill auction amounts to determine their value.Table

To calculate the arithmetic mean of the amount paid for Treasury bills at auction, in billions of dollars, we use
the following formula:
Median
To determine themedianof a data set, order the data from smallest to largest, and then find the middle value
in the ordered data set. For example, to find the median value of 50 portfolios, find the number that splits the
data into two equal parts. The portfolio values owned by 25 people will be below the median, and 25 people
will have portfolio values above the median. The median is generally a better measure of the average when
there areextreme valuesoroutliersin the data set.
An outlier or extreme value is a data value that is significantly different from the other data values in a data
set. The median is preferred when outliers are present because the median is not affected by the numerical
values of the outliers.
The ordered data set fromTable 13.1appears as follows:
The middle value in this ordered data set is the third data value, which is 39.7. Thus, the median is $39.7 billion.
You can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression. The variablenrepresents the
total number of data values in the sample. Ifnis an odd number, the median is the middle value of the data
values when ordered from smallest to largest. Ifnis an even number, the median is equal to the two middle
values of the ordered data values added together and divided by 2. In the example fromTable 13.1, there are
five data values, son= 5. To identify the position of the median, calculate, which is, or 3. This
indicates that the median is located in the third data position, which corresponds to the value 39.7.
As mentioned earlier, when outliers are present in a data set, the mean can be nonrepresentative of the center
of the data set, and the median will provide a better measure of center. The following Think It Through
example illustrates this point.
THINK IT THROUGH
Finding the Measure of Center
Suppose that in a small village of 50 people, one person earns a salary of $5 million per year, and the other
49 individuals each earn $30,000. Which is the better measure ofcenter: the mean or the median?
Solution:
Themean, in dollars, would be arrived at mathematically as follows:
However, themedianwould be $30,000. There are 49 people who earn $30,000 and one person who earns
$5,000,000.
The median is a better measure of the “average” than the mean because 49 of the values are $30,000 and
one is $5,000,000. The $5,000,000 is an outlier. The $30,000 gives us a better sense of the middle of the data
set.
13.1 • Measures of Center383

Mode
Another measure of center is themode. The mode is the most frequent value. There can be more than one
mode in a data set as long as those values have the same frequency and that frequency is the highest. A data
set with two modes is calledbimodal. For example, assume that the weekly closing stock price for a technology
stock, in dollars, is recorded for 20 consecutive weeks as follows:
To find the mode, determine the most frequent score, which is 72. It occurs five times. Thus, the mode of this
data set is 72. It is helpful to know that the most common closing price of this particular stock over the past 20
weeks has been $72.00.
Geometric Mean
The arithmetic mean, median, and mode are all measures of thecenterof a data set, or theaverage. They are
all, in their own way, trying to measure the commonpoint within the data—that which is “normal.” In the case
of the arithmetic mean, this is accomplished by finding the value from which all points are equal linear
distances. We can imagine that all the data values are combined through addition and then distributed back to
each data point in equal amounts.
Thegeometric meanredistributes not the sum of the values but their product. It is calculated by multiplying
all the individual values and then redistributing them in equal portions such that the total product remains the
same. This can be seen from the formula for the geometric mean, x̃ (pronouncedx-tilde):
The geometric mean is relevant in economics and finance for dealing with growth—of markets, in investments,
and so on. For an example of a finance application, assume we would like to know the equivalent percentage
growth rate over a five-year period, given the yearly growth rates for the investment.
For a five-year period, the annual rate of return for acertificate of deposit (CD)investment is as follows:
3.21%, 2.79%, 1.88%, 1.42%, 1.17%. Find the single percentage growth rate that is equivalent to these five
annual consecutive rates of return. The geometric mean of these five rates of return will provide the solution.
To calculate the geometric mean for these values (which must all be positive), first multiply
1
the rates of return
together—after adding 1 to the decimal equivalent of each interest rate—and then take thenth root of the
product. We are interested in calculating the equivalent overall rate of return for the yearly rates of return,
which can be expressed as 1.0321, 1.0279, 1.0188, 1.0142, and 1.0117:
Based on the geometric mean, the equivalent annual rate of return for this time period is 2.09%.

Weighted Mean
Aweighted meanis a measure of the center, or average, of a data set where each data value is assigned a
corresponding weight. A common financial application of a weighted mean is in determining the average price

per share for a certain stock when the stock has been purchased at different points in time and at different
share prices.
To calculate a weighted mean, create a table with the data values in one column and the weights in a second
column. Then create a third column in which each data value is multiplied by each weight on a row-by-row
basis. Then, the weighted mean is calculated as the sum of the results from the third column divided by the
sum of the weights.
THINK IT THROUGH
Calculating the Weighted Mean
Assume your portfolio contains 1,000 shares of XYZ Corporation, purchased on three different dates, as
shown inTable 13.2. Calculate the weighted mean of the purchase price for the 1,000 shares.
Date PurchasedPurchase Price ($)Number of Shares Purchased
Price ($) Times

March 2313150065,500
TotalNA1,000117,700
Table13.21,000 Shares of XYZ Corporation
Solution:
In this example, the purchase price is weighted by the number of shares. The sum of the third column is
$117,700, and sum of the weights is 1,000. The weighted mean is calculated as $117,700 divided by 1,000,
which is $117.70.
Thus, the average cost per share for the 1,000 shares of XYZ Corporation is $117.70.
13.2Measures of Spread
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define and calculate standard deviation for a data set.
•Define and calculate variance for a data set.
•Explain the relationship between standard deviation and variance.
Standard Deviation
An important characteristic of any set of data is the variation in the data. In some data sets, the data values are
concentrated close to the mean; in other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out. For example,
an investor might examine the yearly returns for Stock A, which are 1%, 2%, -1%, 0%, and 3%, and compare
them to the yearly returns for Stock B, which are -9%, 2%, 15%, -5%, and 0%.
Notice that Stock B exhibits more volatility in yearly returns than Stock A. The investor may want to quantify
this variation in order to make the best investment decisions for a particular investment objective.
The most common measure of variation, or spread, is standard deviation. Thestandard deviationof a data
set is a measure of how far the data values are from their mean. A standard deviation
•provides a numerical measure of the overall amount of variation in a data set; and
13.2 • Measures of Spread385

•can be used to determine whether a particular data value is close to or far from the mean.
The standard deviation provides a measure of the overall variation in a data set.The standard deviation is
always positive or zero. It is small when the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little
variation or spread. It is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more
variation.
Suppose that we are studying the variability of two different stocks, Stock A and Stock B. The average stock
price for both stocks is $5. For Stock A, the standard deviation of the stock price is 2, whereas the standard
deviation for Stock B is 4. Because Stock B has a higher standard deviation, we know that there is more
variation in the stock price for Stock B than in the price for Stock A.
There are two different formulas for calculating standard deviation. Which formula to use depends on whether
the data represents a sample or a population. The notationsis used to represent the sample standard
deviation, and the notationis used to represent the population standard deviation. In the formulas shown
below,x̄is the sample mean,is the population mean,nis the sample size, andNis the population size.
Formula for the sample standard deviation:
Formula for the population standard deviation:
Variance
Variancealso provides a measure of the spread of data values. The variance of a data set measures the extent
to which each data value differs from the mean. The more the individual data values differ from the mean, the
larger the variance. Both the standard deviation and the variance provide similar information.
In a finance application, variance can be used to determine the volatility of an investment and therefore to
help guide financial decisions. For example, a more cautious investor might opt for investments with low
volatility.
Similar to standard deviation, the formula used to calculate variance also depends on whether the data is
collected from a sample or a population. The notationis used to represent the sample variance, and the
notationσ

From the statistical results, the mean is shown as 46, and the sample standard deviation is shown as 6.50.
Excel provides a similar analysis using the built-in functions =AVERAGE (for the mean) and =STDEV.S (for the
sample standard deviation). To calculate these statistical results in Excel, enter the data values in a column.
Let’s assume the data values are placed in cells A2 through A11. In any cell, type the Excel command
=AVERAGE(A2:A11) and press enter. Excel will calculate the arithmetic mean in this cell. Then, in any other cell,
type the Excel command =STDEV.S(A2:A11) and press enter. Excel will calculate the sample standard deviation
in this cell.Figure 13.2shows the mean and standard deviation for the 10 ages.
Figure13.2Mean and Standard Deviation in Excel.
Relationship between Standard Deviation and Variance
In the formulas shown above for variance and standard deviation, notice that the variance is the square of the
standard deviation, and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
Once you have calculated one of these values, you can directly calculate the other value. For example, if you
know the standard deviation of a data set is 12.5, you can calculate the variance by squaring this standard
deviation. The variance is then 12.5
2
, which is 156.25.
In the same way, if you know the value of the variance, you can determine the standard deviation by
calculating the square root of the variance. For example, if the variance of a data set is known to be 31.36, then
the standard deviation can be calculated as the square root of 31.36, which is 5.6.
13.2 • Measures of Spread389

One disadvantage of using the variance is that the variance is measured insquare units, which are different
from the units in the data set. For example, if the data set consists of ages measured in years, then the
variance would be measured in years squared, which can be confusing. The standard deviation is measured in
the same units as the original data set, and thus the standard deviation is used more commonly than the
variance to measure the spread of a data set.
13.3Measures of Position
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define and calculatez-scores for a measurement.
•Define and calculate quartiles and percentiles for a data set.
•Use quartiles as a method to detect outliers in a data set.
z-Scores
Az-score, also called az-value, is a measure of the position of an entry in a data set. It represents the number
of standard deviations by which a data value differs from the mean. For example, suppose that in a certain
year, the rates of return for various technology-focused mutual funds are examined, and the mean return is
7.8% with a standard deviation of 2.3%. A certain mutual fund publishes its rate of return as 12.4%. Based on
this rate of return of 12.4%, we can calculate the relative standing of this mutual fund compared to the other
technology-focused mutual funds. The correspondingz-score of a measurement considers the given
measurement in relation to the mean and standard deviation for the entire population.
The formula for az-score calculation is as follows:
wherexis the measurement,is the mean, andis the standard deviation.
THINK IT THROUGH
Interpreting az-Score
A certain technology-based mutual fund reports a rate of return of 12.4% for a certain year, while the mean
rate of return for comparable funds is 7.8% and the standard deviation is 2.3%. Calculate and interpret the
z-score for this particular mutual fund.
Solution:
In this example, the measurementandUsing thez-score formula, the
calculation is performed as follows:
The resultingz-score indicates the number of standard deviations by which a particular measurement is
above or below the mean. In this example, the rate of return for this particular mutual fund is 2 standard
deviations above the mean, indicating that this mutual fund generated a significantly better rate of return
than all other technology-based mutual funds for the same time period.
Quartiles and Percentiles
If a person takes an IQ test, their resulting score might be reported as in the87th percentile. This percentile
indicates the person’s relative performance compared to others taking the IQ test. A person scoring in the
87th percentile has an IQ score higher than 87% of all others taking the test. This is the same as saying that the
39013 • Statistical Analysis in Finance
Access for free at openstax.org

person is in the top 13% of all people taking the IQ test.
Common measures of location arequartilesandpercentiles. Quartiles are special percentiles. The first
quartile,Q
1
, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile,Q
3
, is the same as the 75th percentile.
The median,M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th percentile.
To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles divide
ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths. If you score in the 90th percentile
of an exam, that does not necessarily mean that you receive 90% on the test. It means that 90% of the test
scores are the same as or less than your score and the remaining 10% of the scores are the same as or greater
than your score.
Percentiles are useful for comparing values. In a finance example, a mutual fund might report that the
performance for the fund over the past year was in the 80th percentile of all mutual funds in the peer group.
This indicates that the fund performed better than 80% of all other funds in the peer group. This also indicates
that 20% of the funds performed better than this particular fund.
Quartiles are values that separate the data into quarters. Quartiles may or may not be part of the data. To find
the quartiles, first find the median, or second quartile. The first quartile,Q
1
, is the middle value, or median, of
the lower half of the data, and the third quartile,Q
3
, is the middle value of the upper half of the data. As an
example, consider the following ordered data set, which represents the rates of return for a group of
technology-based mutual funds in a certain year:
The median, or second quartile, is the middle value in this data set, which is 7.2. Notice that 50% of the data
values are below the median, and 50% of the data values are above the median. The lower half of the data
values are 5.4, 6.0, 6.3, 6.8, 7.1 Notice that these are the data values below the median. The upper half of the
data values are 7.4, 7.5, 7.9, 8.2, 8.7, which are the data values above the median.)
To find the first quartile,Q
1
, locate the middle value of the lower half of the data. The middle value of the lower
half of the data set is 6.3. Notice that one-fourth, or 25%, of the data values are below this first quartile, and
75% of the data values are above this first quartile.
To find the third quartile,Q
3
, locate the middle value of the upper half of the data. The middle value of the
upper half of the data set is 7.9. Notice that one-fourth, or 25%, of the data values are above this third quartile,
and 75% of the data values are below this third quartile.
Theinterquartile range (IQR)is a number that indicates the spread of the middle half, or the middle 50%, of
the data. It is the difference between the third quartile,Q
3
, and the first quartile,Q
1
.
In the above example, the IQR can be calculated as
Outlier Detection
Quartiles and the IQR can be used to flag possible outliers in a data set. For example, if most employees at a
company earn about $50,000 and the CEO of the company earns $2.5 million, then we consider the CEO’s
salary to be an outlier data value because is significantly different from all the other salaries in the data set. An
outlier data value can also be a value much lower than the other data values, so if one employee only makes
$15,000, then this employee’s low salary might also be considered an outlier.
To detect outliers, use the quartiles and the IQR to calculate a lower and an upper bound for outliers. Then any
data values below the lower bound or above the upper bound will be flagged as outliers. These data values
should be further investigated to determine the nature of the outlier condition.

5,500,000
No portfolio value price is less than -201,625. However, 5,500,000 is more than 1,159,375. Therefore, the
portfolio value of 5,500,000 is a potential outlier. This is important because the presence of outliers could
potentially indicate data errors or some other anomalies in the data set that should be investigated.
13.4Statistical Distributions
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Construct and interpret a frequency distribution.
•Apply and evaluate probabilities using the normal distribution.
•Apply and evaluate probabilities using the exponential distribution.
Frequency Distributions
Afrequency distributionprovides a method to organize and summarize a data set. For example, we might be
interested in the spread, center, and shape of the data set’s distribution. When a data set has many data
values, it can be difficult to see patterns and come to conclusions about important characteristics of the data.
A frequency distribution allows us to organize and tabulate the data in a summarized way and also to create
graphs to help facilitate an interpretation of the data set.
To create a basic frequency distribution, set up a table with three columns. The first column will show the
intervals for the data, and the second column will show the frequency of the data values, or the count of how
39213 • Statistical Analysis in Finance

many data values fall within each interval. A third column can be added to include the relative frequency for
each row, which is calculated by taking the frequency for that row and dividing it by the sum of all the
frequencies in the table.

Table13.5Portfolio Values for 20
Clients at a Brokerage Firm
($000s)
Create a frequency distribution table using the following intervals for the portfolio values:
Solution:
Create a table where the intervals for portfolio value are listed in the first column. For this example, it was
decided to create a frequency distribution table with seven rows and a class width set to 300. The class
width is the distance from the start of one interval to the start of the next interval in the subsequent row.
For example, the interval for the second row starts at 300, the interval for the third row starts at 600, and so
on.
In the second column, record the frequency, or the number of data values that fall within the interval, for
each row. For example, for the first row, count the number of data values that fall between 0 and 299.
Because there is only one data value (278) that falls in this interval, the corresponding frequency is 1. For
the second row, there are 3 data values that fall between 300 and 599 (318, 422, and 577). Thus, the
frequency for the second row is 3.
For the third column, called relative frequency, take the frequency for each row and divide it by the sum of
the frequencies, which is 20. For example, in the first row, the relative frequency will be 1 divided by 20,
which is 0.05. The relative frequency for the second row will be 3 divided by 20, which is 0.15. The resulting
frequency distribution table is shown inTable 13.6.

Table13.6Frequency Distribution of Portfolio Values for 20 Clients at a
Brokerage Firm ($000s)
The frequency table indicates that most customers have portfolio values between $300,000 and $599,000, as
this row in the table shows the highest frequency. Very few customers have portfolios with a value below
$299,000 or above $1,800,000, as these frequencies in these rows are very low. Because the highest
frequency corresponds to the row in the middle of the table and the frequencies decrease with each
interval below and above this middle interval, the frequency table indicates that this distribution is a bell-
shaped distribution.
The following is a summary of how to create a frequency distribution table (for integer data). Note that the
number of classes in a frequency table is the same as the number of rows in the table.
1.Calculate the class width using the formula
◦Note: For integer data, round the class width up to the next whole number.
2.Create a table with a number of rows equal to the number of classes. Create columns for Lower Class
Limit, Upper Class Limit, Frequency, and Relative Frequency.
3.Set the lower class limit for the first row equal to the minimum value from the data set, or some other
appropriate value.
4.Calculate the lower class limit for the second row by adding the class width to the lower class limit from
the first row. Add the class width to each new lower class limit to calculate the lower class limit for each
subsequent row.
5.The upper class limit for each row is 1 less than the lower class limit of the subsequent row. You can
also add the class width to each upper class limit to determine the upper class limit for the subsequent
row.
6.Record the frequency for each row by counting how many data values fall between the lower class limit
and the upper class limit for that row.
7.Calculate the relative frequency for each row by taking the frequency for that row and dividing by the
total number of data values.
Normal Distribution
The normal probability density function, a continuous distribution, is the most important of all the
distributions. Thenormal distributionis applicable when the frequency of data values decreases with each
class above and below the mean. The normal distribution can be applied to many examples from the finance
industry, including average returns for mutual funds over a certain time period, portfolio values, and others.
The normal distribution has two parameters, or numerical descriptive measures: the mean,, and the
standard deviation,. The variablexrepresents the quantity being measured whose data values have a
39413 • Statistical Analysis in Finance

normal distribution.
Figure13.3Graph of the Normal Distribution
The curve inFigure 13.3is symmetric about a vertical line drawn through the mean,. The mean is the same
as the median, which is the same as the mode, because the graph is symmetric about. As the notation
indicates, the normal distribution depends only on the mean and the standard deviation. Because the area
under the curve must equal 1, a change in the standard deviation,, causes a change in the shape of the
normal curve; the curve becomes fatter and wider or skinnier and taller depending on. A change incauses
the graph to shift to the left or right. This means there are an infinite number of normal probability
distributions.
To determine probabilities associated with the normal distribution, we find specific areas under the normal
curve, and this is further discussed inApply the Normal Distribution in Financial Contexts. For example,
suppose that at a financial consulting company, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with a standard
deviation of $7,500. A normal curve can be drawn to represent this scenario, in which the mean of $60,000
would be plotted on the horizontal axis, corresponding to the peak of the curve. Then, to find the probability
that an employee earns more than $75,000, you would calculate the area under the normal curve to the right
of the data value $75,000.
Excel uses the following command to find the area under the normal curve to theleftof a specified value:
=NORM.DIST(XVALUE, MEAN, STANDARD_DEV, TRUE)
For example, at the financial consulting company mentioned above, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with
a standard deviation of $7,500. To find the probability that a random employee’s salary is less than $55,000
using Excel, this is the command you would use:
=NORM.DIST(55000, 60000, 7500, TRUE)
Result: 0.25249
Thus, there is a probability of about 25% that a random employee has a salary less than $55,000.
Exponential Distribution
Theexponential distributionis often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs. For
example, a finance professional might want to model the time to default on payments for company debt
holders.
An exponential distribution is one in which there are fewer large values and more small values. For example,
marketing studies have shown that the amount of money customers spend in a store follows an exponential
distribution. There are more people who spend small amounts of money and fewer people who spend large
amounts of money.
Exponential distributions are commonly used in calculations of product reliability, or the length of time a
product lasts. The random variable for the exponential distribution is continuous and often measures a
13.4 • Statistical Distributions395

passage of time, although it can be used in other applications. Typical questions may be, What is the
probability that some event will occur betweenx
1
hours andx
2
hours? or What is the probability that the event
will take more thanx
1
hours to perform? In these examples, the random variablexequals either the time
between events or the passage of time to complete an action (e.g., wait on a customer). The probability
density function is given by
whereis the historical average of the values of the random variable (e.g., the historical average waiting
time). This probability density function has a mean and standard deviation of.
To determine probabilities associated with the exponential distribution, we find specific areas under the
exponential distribution curve. The following formula can be used to calculate the area under the exponential
curve to the left of a certain value:

To calculate the probability, find the area under the curve to the left of 1 minute. The mean time is given as
45 seconds, which is the same as 0.75 minutes. The probability can then be calculated as follows:
13.5Probability Distributions
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate portfolio weights in an investment.
•Calculate and interpret the expected values.
•Apply the normal distribution to characterize average and standard deviation in financial contexts.
Calculate Portfolio Weights
In many financial analyses, theweightingsby asset category in aportfolioare a key index used to assess if
the portfolio is meeting allocation metrics. For example, an investor approaching retirement age may wish to
shift assets in a portfolio to more conservative andlower-volatility investments. Weightings can be calculated
in several different ways—for example, based on individual stocks in a portfolio or on various sectors in a
portfolio. Weightings can also be calculated based on number of shares or the value of shares of a stock.
To calculate a weighting in a portfolio based on value, take the value of the particular investment and divide it
by the total value of the overall portfolio. As an example, consider an individual’s retirement account for which
the desired portfolio weighting is determined to be 40% stocks, 50% bonds, and 10% cash equivalents.Table

equivalents.

Portfolio rebalancing is a process whereby the investor buys or sells assets to achieve the desired portfolio
weightings. In this example, the investor could sell approximately 10% of the stock assets and purchase bonds
with the proceeds to align the asset categories to the desired portfolio weightings.
Calculate and Interpret Expected Values
Aprobability distributionis a mathematical function that assigns probabilities to various outcomes. For
example, we can assign a probability to the outcome of a certain stock increasing in value or decreasing in
value. One application of a probability distribution function is determiningexpected value.
In many financial situations, we are interested in determining the expected value of the return on a particular
investment or the expected return on a portfolio of multiple investments. To calculate expected returns, we
formulate a probability distribution and then use the following formula to calculate expected value:

are derived from historical data. As an example, consider a probability distribution for
13.5 • Probability Distributions397

potential returns forUnited Airlinescommon stock. Assume that from historical data gathered over a certain
time period, there is a 15% probability of generating a 12% return on investment for this stock, a 35%
probability of generating a 5% return, a 25% probability of generating a 2% return, a 14% probability of
generating a 5% loss, and an 11% probability of resulting in a 10% loss. This data can be organized into a
probability distribution table as seen inTable 13.9.
Using the expected value formula, the expected return of United Airlines stock over an extended period of
time follows:
Based on the probability distribution, the expected value of the rate of return for United Airlines common
stock over an extended period of time is 2.25%.

asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents, where the probabilities are associated with the
weighting of each category relative to the total value of the portfolio. Using historical return data for each of
the asset categories, the expected return of the overall portfolio can be calculated using the expected value
formula.
Assume an investor has assets in stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents as shown inTable 13.10.

Apply the Normal Distribution in Financial Contexts
The normal, or bell-shaped, distribution can be utilized in many applications, including financial contexts.

Remember that the normal distribution has two parameters: the mean, which is the center of the distribution,
and the standard deviation, which measures the spread of the distribution. Here are several examples of
applications of the normal distribution:
•IQ scores follow a normal distribution, with a mean IQ score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.
•Salaries at a certain company follow a normal distribution, with a mean salary of $52,000 and a standard
deviation of $4,800.
•Grade point averages (GPAs) at a certain college follow a normal distribution, with a mean GPA of 3.27 and
a standard deviation of 0.24.
•The average annual gain of theDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)over a 40-year time period follows a
normal distribution, with a mean gain of 485 points and a standard deviation of 1,065 points.
•The average annual return on theS&P 500over a 50-year time period follows a normal distribution, with a
mean rate of return of 10.5% and a standard deviation of 14.3%.
•The average annual return on mid-cap stock funds over the five-year period from 2010 to 2015 follows a
normal distribution, with a mean rate of return of 8.9% and a standard deviation of 3.7%.
When analyzing data sets that follow a normal distribution, probabilities can be calculated by finding areas
under the normal curve. To find the probability that a measurement is within a specific interval, we can
compute the area under the normal curve corresponding to the interval of interest.
Areas under the normal curve are available in tables, andExcelalso provides a method to find these areas. The
empirical ruleis one method for determining areas under the normal curve that fall within a certain number
of standard deviations of the mean (seeFigure 13.4).
Figure13.4Normal Distribution Showing Mean and Increments of Standard Deviation
Ifxis a random variable and has a normal distribution with meanμand standard deviation, then the
empirical rule states the following:
•About 68% of thex-values lie betweenandunits from the mean(within one standard deviation
of the mean).
•About 95% of thex-values lie betweenandunits from the mean(within two standard
deviations of the mean).
•About 99.7% of thex-values lie betweenandunits from the mean(within three standard
deviations of the mean). Notice that almost all thex-values lie within three standard deviations of the
mean.

As an example of using the empirical rule, suppose we know that the average annual return for mid-cap stock
funds over the five-year period from 2010 to 2015 follows a normal distribution, with a mean rate of return of
8.9% and a standard deviation of 3.7%. We are interested in knowing the likelihood that a randomly selected
mid-cap stock fund provides a rate of return that falls within one standard deviation of the mean, which
13.5 • Probability Distributions399

implies a rate of return between 5.2% and 12.6%. Using the empirical rule, the area under the normal curve
within one standard deviation of the mean is 68%. Thus, there is a probability, or likelihood, of 0.68 that a mid-
cap stock fund will provide a rate of return between 5.2% and 12.6%.
If the interval of interest is extended to two standard deviations from the mean (a rate of return between 1.5%
and 16.3%), using the empirical rule, we can determine that the area under the normal curve within two
standard deviations of the mean is 95%. Thus, there is a probability, or likelihood, of 0.95 that a mid-cap stock
fund will provide a rate of return between 1.5% and 16.3%.
13.6Data Visualization and Graphical Displays
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Determine appropriate graphs to use for various types of data.
•Create and interpret univariate graphs such as bar graphs and histograms.
•Create and interpret bivariate graphs such as time series graphs and scatter plot graphs.
Graphing Univariate Data
Data visualizationrefers to the use of graphical displays to summarize data to help to interpret patterns and
trends in the data.Univariate datarefers to observations recorded for a single characteristic or attribute, such
as salaries or blood pressure measurements. When graphing univariate data, we can choose from among
several types of graphs, such as bar graphs, time series graphs, and so on.
The most effective type of graph to use for a certain data set will depend on the nature of the data and the
purpose of the graph. For example, a time series graph is typically used to show how a measurement is
changing over time and to identify patterns or trends over time.
Below are some examples of typical applications for various graphs and displays.
Graphs used to show the distribution of data:
•Bar chart: used to show frequency or relative frequency distributions for categorical data
•Histogram: used to show frequency or relative frequency distributions for continuous data
Graphs used to show relationships between data points:
•Time series graph: used to show measurement data plotted against time, where time is displayed on the
horizontal axis
•Scatter plot: used to show the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable
Bar Graphs
Abar graphconsists of bars that are separated from each other and compare percentages. The bars can be
rectangles, or they can be rectangular boxes (used in three-dimensional plots), and they can be vertical or
horizontal. The bar graph shown in the example below has age groups represented on thex-axisand
proportions on they-axis.
By the end of 2021, a certain social media site had over 146 million users in the United States.Table 13.11
shows three age groups, the number of users in each age group, and the proportion (%) of users in each age
group. A bar graph using this data is shown inFigure 13.5.

Histograms
Ahistogramis a bar graph that is used for continuous numeric data, such as salaries, blood pressures,
heights, and so on. One advantage of a histogram is that it can readily display large data sets. A rule of thumb
is to use a histogram when the data set consists of 100 values or more.
A histogram consists of contiguous (adjoining) boxes. It has both a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. The
horizontal axis is labeled with what the data represents (for instance, distance from your home to school). The
vertical axis is labeled either Frequency or Relative Frequency (or Percent Frequency or Probability). The graph
will have the same shape regardless of the label on the vertical axis. A histogram, like a stem-and-leaf plot, can
give you the shape of the data, the center, and the spread of the data.
The relative frequency is equal to the frequency of an observed data value divided by the total number of data
values in the sample. Remember, frequency is defined as the number of times a solution occurs. Relative
frequency is calculated using the formula
wheref= frequency,n= the total number of data values (or the sum of the individual frequencies), andRF=
relative frequency.
To construct a histogram, first decide how many bars or intervals, also called classes, will represent the data.
Many histograms consist of 5 to 15 bars or classes for clarity. The number of bars needs to be chosen. Choose
a starting point for the first interval that is less than the smallest data value. A convenient starting point is a
lower value carried out to one more decimal place than the value with the most decimal places. For example, if
the value with the most decimal places is 6.1, and if this is the smallest value, a convenient starting point is
6.05 (because). We say that 6.05 has more precision. If the value with the most decimal
places is 2.23 and the lowest value is 1.5, a convenient starting point is 1.495 (). If the value
with the most decimal places is 3.234 and the lowest value is 1.0, a convenient starting point is
. If all the data values happen to be integers and the smallest value is 2, then a
convenient starting point is. Also, when the starting point and other boundaries are
carried to one additional decimal place, no data value will fall on a boundary. The next two examples go into
detail about how to construct a histogram using continuous data and how to create a histogram using discrete
data.

72, 72, 72, 72.5, 72.5, 73, 73.5
74
The smallest data value is 60. Because the data values with the most decimal places have one decimal place
(for instance, 61.5), we want our starting point to have two decimal places. Because the numbers 0.5, 0.05,
0.005, and so on are convenient numbers, use 0.05 and subtract it from 60, the smallest value, to get a
convenient starting point:, which is more precise than, say, 61.5 by one decimal place. Thus,
the starting point is 59.95. The largest value is 74, and, so 74.05 is the ending value.
Next, calculate the width of each bar or class interval. To calculate this width, subtract the starting point from
the ending value and divide the result by the number of bars (you must choose the number of bars you
desire). Suppose you choose eight bars. The interval width is calculated as follows:
We will round up to 2 and make each bar or class interval 2 units wide. Rounding up to 2 is one way to prevent
a value from falling on a boundary. Rounding to the next number is often necessary, even if it goes against the
standard rules of rounding. For this example, using 1.76 as the width would also work. A guideline that is
followed by some for the width of a bar or class interval is to take the square root of the number of data values
and then round to the nearest whole number if necessary. For example, if there are 150 data values, take the
square root of 150 and round to 12 bars or intervals. The boundaries are as follows:
The data values 60 through 61.5 are in the interval 59.95–61.95. The data values of 63.5 are in the interval
61.95–63.95. The data values of 64 and 64.5 are in the interval 63.95–65.95. The data values 66 through 67.5 are
in the interval 65.95–67.95. The data values 68 through 69.5 are in the interval 67.95–69.95. The data values 70
through 71 are in the interval 69.95–71.95. The data values 72 through 73.5 are in the interval 71.95–73.95. The
data value 74 is in the interval 73.95–75.95. The histogram shown inFigure 13.6displays the portfolio values on
thex-axis and relative frequency on they-axis.

Graphing Bivariate Data
Bivariate datarefers to paired data, where each value of one variable is paired with a value of a second
variable. An example of paired data would be if data were collected on employees’ years of experience and
their corresponding salaries. Typically, it is of interest to investigate possible associations or correlations
between the two variables under analysis.
Time Series Graphs
Suppose that we want to track theconsumer price index (CPI)over the past 10 years. One feature of the data
that we may want to consider is the element of time. Because each year is paired with the CPI value for that
year, we do not have to think of the data as being random. We can instead use the years given to impose a
chronological order on the data. A graph that recognizes this ordering and displays the changing CPI value as
the decade progresses is called a time series graph.
To construct atime series graph, we must look at both pieces of our paired data set. We start with a standard
Cartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is used to plot the time increments, and the vertical axis is
used to plot the values of the variable that we are measuring. By doing this, we make each point on the graph
correspond to a point in time and a measured quantity. The points on the graph are typically connected by
straight lines in the order in which they occur.
Example:The following data set shows the annual CPI for 10 years. We need to construct a time series graph
for the (rounded) annual CPI data (seeTable 13.12). The time series graph is shown inFigure 13.7.

Scatter Plots
Ascatter plot, or scatter diagram, is a graphical display intended to show the relationship between two
variables. The setup of the scatter plot is that one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other
variable is plotted on the vertical axis. Then each pair of data values is considered as an (x,y) point, and the
various points are plotted on the diagram. A visual inspection of the plot is then made to detect any patterns
or trends. Additional statistical analysis can be conducted to determine if there is a correlation or other
statistically significant relationship between the two variables.
Assume we are interested in tracking the closing price ofNikestock over the one-year time period from April
2020 to March 2021. We would also like to know if there is a correlation or relationship between the price of
Nike stock and the value of the S&P 500 over the same time period. To visualize this relationship, we can create
a scatter plot based on the (x,y) data shown inTable 13.13.The resulting scatter plot is shown inFigure 13.8.

13.7The R Statistical Analysis Tool
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Create a vector of data values for theR statistical analysis tool.
•Write basic statistical commands using the R statistical analysis tool.
Commands and Vectors in R
R is a statistical analysis tool that is widely used in the finance industry. It is available as a free program and
provides an integrated suite of functions for data analysis, graphing, and statistical programming. R is
increasingly being used as a data analysis and statistical tool as it is an open-source language and additional
features are constantly being added by the user community. The tool can be used on many different
computing platforms and can be downloaded atthe R Project website(https://openstax.org/r/the-R-project-
website).
LINK TO LEARNING
Using the R Statistical Tool
There are many resources for learning and using the R statistical tool, including the following:
How to install R on different computer operating systems(https://openstax.org/r/how-to-install)
Introduction to using R(https://openstax.org/r/introduction-to-using-R)
How to import and export data using R(https://openstax.org/r/how-to-import-and-export)
Frequently asked questions (FAQ) on using R(https://openstax.org/r/frequently-asked-questions)
Once you have installed and started R on your computer, at the bottom of the R console, you should see the
symbol >, which indicates that R is ready to accept commands.
Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or 'help.start()' for an HTML
browser interface to help. Type 'q()' to quit R.
>
R is a command-driven language, meaning that the user enters commands at the prompt, which R then
executes one at a time. R can also execute a program containing multiple commands. There are ways to add a
graphic user interface (GUI)to R. An example of a GUI tool for R isRStudio(https://openstax.org/r/RStudio).
The R command line can be used to perform any numeric calculation, similar to a handheld calculator. For

and hit return:

[1] 31
Most calculations in R are handled via functions. For statistical analysis, there are many preestablished
functions in R to calculate mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, and so on. Variables can be named and
assigned values using the assignment operator <-. For example, the following R commands assign the value of
20 to the variable namedxand assign the value of 30 to the variable namedy:
> x <- 20
> y <- 30
These variable names can be used in any calculation, such as multiplyingxbyyto produce the result 600:
> x*y
[1] 600
The typical method for using functions in statistical applications is to first create a vector of data values. There
are several ways to create vectors in R. For example, thecfunction is often used to combine values into a
vector. The following R command will generate a vector calledsalariesthat contains the data values 40,000,
50,000, 75,000, and 92,000:
> salaries <- c(40000, 50000, 75000, 92000)
This vectorsalariescan then be used in statistical functions such as mean, median, min, max, and so on, as
shown:
> mean(salaries)
[1] 64250
> median(salaries)
[1] 62500
> min(salaries)
[1] 40000
> max(salaries)
[1] 92000
13.7 • The R Statistical Analysis Tool407

Another option for generating a vector in R is to use theseqfunction, which will automatically generate a
sequence of numbers. For example, we can generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5, incremented by 0.5,
and call this vectorexample1, as follows:
> example1 <- seq(1, 5, by=0.5)
If we then type the name of the vector and hit enter, R will provide a listing of numeric values for that vector
name.
> salaries
[1] 40000 50000 75000 92000
> example1
[1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0
Often, we are interested in generating a quick statistical summary of a data set in the form of its mean,
median, quartiles, min, and max. The R command calledsummaryprovides these results.
> summary(salaries)
Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max.
40000 47500 62500 64250 79250 92000
For measures of spread, R includes a command for standard deviation, calledsd, and a command for variance,
calledvar. The standard deviation and variance are calculated with the assumption that the data set was
collected from a sample.
> sd(salaries)
[1] 23641.42
> var(salaries)
[1] 558916667
To calculate a weighted mean in R, create two vectors, one of which contains the data values and the other of
which contains the associated weights. Then enter the R commandweighted.mean(values, weights).
The following is an example of a weighted mean calculation in R:
Assume your portfolio contains 1,000 shares of XYZ Corporation, purchased on three different dates, as shown
inTable 13.14. Calculate the weighted mean of the purchase price, where the weights are based on the
number of shares in the portfolio.

Here is how you would create two vectors in R: thepricevector will contain the purchase price, and theshares
vector will contain the number of shares. Then execute the R commandweighted.mean(price, shares), as
follows:
> price <- c(78, 122, 131)
> shares <- c(200, 300, 500)

Graphing in R
There are many statistical applications in R, and many graphical representations are possible, such as bar
graphs, histograms, time series plots, scatter plots, and others. The basic command to create a plot in R is the
13.7 • The R Statistical Analysis Tool409

plot command,plot(x, y), wherexis a vector containing thex-values of the data set andyis a vector containing
they-values of the data set.
The general format of the command is as follows:
>plot(x, y, main="text for title of graph", xlab="text for x-axis label", ylab="text
for y-axis label")
For example, we are interested in creating a scatter plot to examine the correlation between the value of the
S&P 500 and Nike stock prices. Assume we have the data shown inTable 13.13, collected over a one-year time
period.
Note that data can be read into R from a text file or Excel file or from the clipboard by using various R
commands. Assume the values of the S&P 500 have been loaded into the vectorSP500and the values of Nike
stock prices have been loaded into the vectorNike. Then, to generate the scatter plot, we can use the following
R command:
>plot(SP500, Nike, main="Scatter Plot of Nike Stock Price vs. S&P 500", xlab="S&P
500", ylab="Nike Stock Price")
As a result of these commands, R provides the scatter plot shown inFigure 13.10. This is the same data that
was used to generate the scatter plot inFigure 13.8in Excel.

Summary
13.1Measures of Center
Several measurements are used to provide the average of a data set, including mean, median, and mode. The
termsmeanandaverageare often used interchangeably. To calculate the mean for a set of numbers, add the
numbers together and then divide the sum by the number of data values. The geometric mean redistributes
not the sum of the values but the product by multiplying all of the individual values and then redistributing
them in equal portions such that the total product remains the same. To calculate the median for a set of
numbers, order the data from smallest to largest and identify the middle data value in the ordered data set.
13.2Measures of Spread
The standard deviation and variance are measures of the spread of a data set. The standard deviation is small
when the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard
deviation is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more variation. The
formula used to calculate the standard deviation depends on whether the data represents a sample or a
population, as the formulas for the sample standard deviation and the population standard deviation are
slightly different.
13.3Measures of Position
Several measures are used to indicate the position of a data value in a data set. One measure of position is the
z-score for a particular measurement. Thez-score indicates how many standard deviations a particular
measurement is above or below the mean. Other measures of position include quartiles and percentiles.
Quartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile,Q
1
, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile,
Q
3
, is the same as the 75th percentile. The median,M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th
percentile. To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles
divide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths.
13.4Statistical Distributions
A frequency distribution provides a method of organizing and summarizing a data set and allows us to
organize and tabulate the data in a summarized way. Once a frequency distribution is generated, it can be
used to create graphs to help facilitate an interpretation of the data set. The normal distribution has two
parameters, or numerical descriptive measures: the mean,, and the standard deviation,. The exponential
distribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs.
13.5Probability Distributions
A probability distribution is a mathematical function that assigns probabilities to various outcomes. In many
financial situations, we are interested in determining the expected value of the return on a particular
investment or the expected return on a portfolio of multiple investments. When analyzing distributions that
follow a normal distribution, probabilities can be calculated by finding the area under the graph of the normal
curve.
13.6Data Visualization and Graphical Displays
Data visualizationrefers to the use of graphical displays to summarize a data set to help to interpret patterns
and trends in the data.Univariate datarefers to observations recorded for a single characteristic or attribute,
such as salaries or blood pressure measurements. When graphing univariate data, we can choose from among
several types of graphs. The type of graph to be used for a certain data set will depend on the nature of the
data and the purpose of the graph. Examples of graphs for univariate data include line graphs, bar graphs,
and histograms.Bivariate datarefers to paired data where each value of one variable is paired with a value of
a second variable. Examples of graphs for bivariate data include time series graphs and scatter plots.

Why It Matters
Correlation and regression analysis are used extensively in finance applications.Correlation analysisallows the
determination of a statistical relationship between two numeric quantities. Regression analysis can be used to
predict one quantity based on a second quantity, assuming there is a significant correlation between the two
quantities. For example, in finance, we use regression analysis to calculate the beta coefficient of a stock,
which represents the volatility of the stock versus overall market volatility, with volatility being a measure of
risk.
A business may want to establish a correlation between the amount the company spent on advertising versus
its recorded sales. If a strong enough correlation is established, then the business manager can predict sales
based on the amount spent on advertising for a given time period.
Finance professionals often use correlation analysis to predict future trends and mitigate risk in a stock
portfolio. For example, if two investments are strongly correlated, an investor might not want to have both
investments in a certain portfolio since the two investments would tend to move in the same directions during
up markets or down markets. To diversify a portfolio, an investor might seek investments that are not strongly
correlated with one another.
Regression analysiscan be used to establish a mathematical equation that relates a dependent variable (such
as sales) to an independent variable (such as advertising expenditure). In this discussion, the focus will be on

analyzing the relationship between one dependent variable and one independent variable, where the
relationship can be modeled using a linear equation. This type of analysis is calledlinear regression.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate a correlation coefficient.
•Interpret a correlation coefficient.
•Test for the significance of a correlation coefficient.
Calculate a Correlation Coefficient
In correlation analysis, we study the relationship between bivariate data, which is data collected on two
variables where the data values are paired with one another.
Correlationis the measure of association between two numeric variables. For example, we may be interested
to know if there is a correlation between bond prices and interest rates or between the age of a car and the
value of the car. To investigate the correlation between two numeric quantities, the first step is to create a
scatter plot that will graph the (x, y) ordered pairs. The independent, or explanatory, quantity is labeled as the
x-variable, and the dependent, or response, quantity is labeled as they-variable.
For example, we may be interested to know if the price ofNikestock is correlated with the value of theS&P 500
(Standard & Poor’s 500 stock market index). To investigate this, monthly data can be collected for Nike stock
prices and value of the S&P 500 for a period of time, and a scatter plot can be created and examined. Ascatter
plot, orscatter diagram, is a graphical display intended to show the relationship between two variables. The
setup of the scatter plot is that one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other variable is plotted
on the vertical axis. Each pair of data values is considered as an (x, y) point, and the various points are plotted
on the diagram. A visual inspection of the plot is then made to detect any patterns or trends on the scatter
diagram.Table 14.1shows the relationship between the Nike stock price and its S&P value over a one-year
time period.
To assess linear correlation, the graphical trend of the data points is examined on the scatter plot to determine
if a straight-line pattern exists. If a linear pattern exists, the correlation may indicate either a positive or a
negative correlation. A positive correlation indicates that as the independent variable increases, the dependent
variable tends to increase as well, or, as the independent variable decreases, the dependent variable tends to
decrease (the two quantities move in the same direction). A negative correlation indicates that as the
independent variable increases, the dependent variable decreases, or, as the independent variable decreases,
the dependent variable increases (the two quantities move in opposite directions). If there is no relationship or
association between the two quantities, where one quantity changing does not affect the other quantity, we
conclude that there is no correlation between the two variables.

From the scatter plot in the Nike stock versus S&P 500 example (seeFigure 14.2), we note that the trend
reflects a positive correlation in that as the value of the S&P 500 increases, the price of Nike stock tends to
increase as well.

When inspecting a scatter plot, it may be difficult to assess a correlation based on a visual inspection of the
graph alone. A more precise assessment of the correlation between the two quantities can be obtained by
calculating the numeric correlation coefficient (referred to using the symbolr).
Thecorrelation coefficient, which was developed by statistician Karl Pearson in the early 1900s, is a measure
of the strength and direction of the correlation between the independent variablexand the dependent
variabley.
The formula forris shown below; however, technology, such as Excel or the statistical analysis program R, is
typically used to calculate the correlation coefficient.

strength of the correlation for the two population variables. Sample data indicates data based on a subset of
the entire population.
Given the complexity of this calculation, Excel or other software is typically used to calculate the correlation

that the relationship between Nike stock and the value of the S&P 500 over this time period represents a
strong, positive correlation.
Note: A strong correlation does not suggest thatxcausesyorycausesx. We must remember thatcorrelation
does not imply causation.
Test a Correlation Coefficient for Significance
The correlation coefficient,r, tells us about the strength and direction of the linear relationship betweenxand
y. The sample data are used to computer, the correlation coefficient for the sample. If we had data for the
entire population (that is, all measurements of interest), we could find the population correlation coefficient,
which is labeled as the Greek letterρ(pronounced “rho”). But because we have only sample data, we cannot
calculate the population correlation coefficient. The sample correlation coefficient,r, is our estimate of the
unknown population correlation coefficient.
•ρ= population correlation coefficient (unknown)
•r= sample correlation coefficient (known; calculated from sample data)
An important step in the correlation analysis is to determine if the correlation is significant. By this, we are
asking if the correlation is strong enough to allow meaningful predictions forybased on values ofx. One
method to test the significance of the correlation is to employ a hypothesis test. The hypothesis test lets us
decide whether the value of the population correlation coefficientρis close to zero or significantly different
from zero. We decide this based on the sample correlation coefficientrand the sample sizen.
If the test concludes that the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, we say that the
correlation coefficient is significant.
•Conclusion: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship betweenx
andyvariables because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero.
•What the conclusion means: There is a significant linear relationship between thexandyvariables. If the
test concludes that the correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero (it is close to zero), we
say that the correlation coefficient is not significant.
A hypothesis test can be performed to test if the correlation is significant. A hypothesis test is a statistical
method that uses sample data to test a claim regarding the value of a population parameter. In this case, the
hypothesis test will be used to test the claim that the population correlation coefficientρis equal to zero.
Use these hypotheses when performing the hypothesis test:
•Null hypothesis:
•Alternate hypothesis:
The hypotheses can be stated in words as follows:
•Null hypothesis: The population correlation coefficientis notsignificantly different from zero. Thereis
nota significant linear relationship (correlation) betweenxandyin the population.
42214 • Regression Analysis in Finance

•Alternate hypothesis: The population correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero. There
isa significant linear relationship (correlation) betweenxandyin the population.
A quick shorthand way to test correlations is the relationship between the sample size and the correlation. If
then this implies that the correlation between the two variables demonstrates that a linear
relationship exists and is statistically significant at approximately the 0.05 level of significance. As the formula
indicates, there is an inverse relationship between the sample size and the required correlation for significance
of a linear relationship. With only 10 observations, the required correlation for significance is 0.6325; for 30
observations, the required correlation for significance decreases to 0.3651; and at 100 observations, the
required level is only 0.2000.
NOTE:
•Ifris significant and the scatter plot shows a linear trend, the line can be used to predict the value ofyfor
values ofxthat are within the domain of observedx-values.
•Ifris not significant OR if the scatter plot does not show a linear trend, the line should not be used for
prediction.
•Ifris significant and the scatter plot shows a linear trend, the line maynotbe appropriate or reliable for
predictionoutsidethe domain of observedx-values in the data.
THINK IT THROUGH
Determining If a Correlation Is Significant
Suppose that thechief financial officer (CFO)of a corporation is investigating the correlation between stock
prices and unemployment rate over a period of 10 years and finds the correlation coefficient to be -0.68.
There are 10 (x, y) data points in the data set. Should the CFO conclude that the correlation is significant for
the relationship between stock prices and unemployment rate based on a level of significance of 0.05?
Solution:
When using a level of significance of 0.05, ifthen this implies that the correlation between the
two variables demonstrates a linear relationship that is statistically significant at approximately the 0.05
level of significance. In this example, we check ifis greater than or equal towhere.
Sinceis approximately 0.632, this indicates that the absolute value ofrofis greater than,
and thus the correlation is deemed as significant.
Correlations may be helpful in visualizing the data, but they are not appropriately used to explain a
relationship between two variables. Perhaps no single statistic is more misused than the correlation
coefficient. Citing correlations between health conditions and everything from place of residence to eye color
have the effect of implying a cause-and-effect relationship. This simply cannot be accomplished with a
correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient is, of course, innocent of this misinterpretation. It is the duty
of analysts to use a statistic that is designed to test for cause-and-effect relationships and to report only those
results, if they are intending to make such a claim. The problem is that passing this more rigorous test is
difficult, therefore lazy and/or unscrupulous researchers fall back on correlations when they cannot make their
case legitimately.

14.2Linear Regression Analysis
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Analyze a regression using the method of least squares and residuals.
•Test the assumptions for linear regression.
Method of Least Squares and Residuals
Once the correlation coefficient has been calculated and a determination has been made that the correlation
is significant, typically a regression model is then developed. In this discussion we will focus on linear
regression, where a straight line is used to model the relationship between the two variables. Once a straight-
line model is developed, this model can then be used to predict the value of the dependent variable for a
specific value of the independent variable.
Recall from algebra that the equation of a straight line is given by
wheremis the slope of the line andbis they-intercept of the line.
The slope measures the steepness of the line, and they-intercept is that point on they-axis where the graph
crosses, or intercepts, they-axis.
In linear regression analysis, the equation of the straight line is written in a slightly different way using the
model
In this format,bis the slope of the line, andais they-intercept. The notationis calledy-hatand is used to
indicate a predicted value of the dependent variableyfor a certain value of the independent variablex.
If a line extends uphill from left to right, the slope is a positive value, and if the line extends downhill from left
to right, the slope is a negative value. Refer toFigure 14.3.
Figure14.3Three Possible Graphs of(a) If, the line slopes upward to the right. (b) If, the line is horizontal.
(c) If, the line slopes downward to the right.
When generating the equation of a line in algebra using, two (x, y) points were required to
generate the equation. However, in regression analysis, all (x, y) points in the data set will be utilized to
develop the linear regression model.
The first step in any regression analysis is to create the scatter plot. Then proceed to calculate the correlation

would like to draw a line on the scatter plot. This line can be calculated through a process called linear
regression. However, we only calculate a regression line if one of the variables helps to explain or predict the
other variable. Ifxis the independent variable andythe dependent variable, then we can use a regression line
to predictyfor a given value ofx.
As an example of a regression equation, assume that a correlation exists between the monthly amount spent

on advertising and the monthly revenue for aFortune 500company. After collecting (x, y) data for a certain
time period, the company determines the regression equation is of the form
wherexrepresents the monthly amount spent on advertising (in thousands of dollars) andrepresents the
monthly revenues for the company (in thousands of dollars).
A scatter plot of the (x, y) data is shown inFigure 14.4.
Figure14.4Scatter Plot of Revenue versus Advertising for a Fortune 500 Company ($000s)
The Fortune 500 company would like to predict the monthly revenue if its executives decide to spend $150,000
in advertising next month. To determine the estimate of monthly revenue, letin the regression
equation and calculate a corresponding value for:
This predicted value ofyindicates that the anticipated revenue would be $18,646,700, given the advertising
spend of $150,000.
Notice that from past data, there may have been a month where the company actually did spend $150,000 on
advertising, and thus the company may have an actual result for the monthly revenue. This actual, or
observed, amount can be compared to thepredictionfrom the linear regression model to calculate a residual.
Aresidualis the difference between an observedy-value and the predictedy-value obtained from the linear
regression equation. As an example, assume that in a previous month, the actual monthly revenue for an
advertising spend of $150,000 was $19,200,000, and thus. The residual for this data point can be
calculated as follows:
Notice that residuals can be positive, negative, or zero. If the observedy-value exactly matches the predicted
y-value, then the residual will be zero. If the observedy-value is greater than the predictedy-value, then the
residual will be a positive value. If the observedy-value is less than the predictedy-value, then the residual will
be a negative value.
When formulating the linear regression line of best fit to the points on the scatter plot, the mathematical
14.2 • Linear Regression Analysis425

analysis generates a linear equation where the sum of the squared residuals is minimized. This analysis is
referred to as themethod of least squares. The result is that the analysis generates a linear equation that is
the “best fit” to the points on the scatter plot, in the sense that the line minimizes the differences between the
predicted values and observed values fory.
THINK IT THROUGH
Calculating a Residual
Suppose that the chief financial officer of a corporation has created a linear model for the relationship
between the company stock and interest rates. When interest rates are at 5%, the company stock has a
value of $94. Using the linear model, when interest rates are at 5%, the model predicts the value of the
company stock to be $99. Calculate the residual for this data point.
Solution:
A residual is the difference between an observedy-value and the predictedy-value obtained from the linear
regression equation
The goal in the regression analysis is to determine the coefficientsaandbin the following regression
equation:
Once the (x, y) has been collected, the slope (b) andy-intercept (a) can be calculated using the following
formulas:
wherenrefers to the number of data pairs andindicates sum of thex-values.
Notice that the formula for they-intercept requires the use of the slope result (b), and thus the slope should
be calculated first and they-intercept should be calculated second.
When making predictions fory, it is always important to plot a scatter diagram first. If the scatter plot indicates
that there is a linear relationship between the variables, then it is reasonable to use a best-fit line to make
predictions fory,givenxwithin the domain ofx-values in the sample data,but not necessarily forx-values
outside that domain.
Note: Computer spreadsheets, statistical software, and many calculators can quickly calculate the best-fit line
and create the graphs. The calculations tend to be tedious if done by hand.
Assumptions for Linear Regression
Testing the significance of the correlation coefficient requires that certain assumptions about the data are
satisfied. The premise of this test is that the data are a sample of observed points taken from a larger
population. We have not examined the entire population because it is not possible or feasible to do so. We are
examining the sample to draw a conclusion about whether the linear relationship that we see betweenxandy
in the sample data provides strong enough evidence that we can conclude that there is a linear relationship
42614 • Regression Analysis in Finance
Access for free at openstax.org

betweenxandyin the population.
The regression line equation that we calculate from the sample data gives the best-fit line for our particular
sample. We want to use this best-fit line for the sample as an estimate of the best-fit line for the population
(Figure 14.5). Examining the scatter plot and testing the significance of the correlation coefficient helps us
determine if it is appropriate to do this.
These are the assumptions underlying the test of significance:
1.There is a linear relationship in the population that models the average value ofyfor varying values ofx.
In other words, the expected value ofyfor each particular value lies on a straight line in the population.
(We do not know the equation for the line for the population. Our regression line from the sample is our
best estimate of this line in the population.)
2.They-values for any particularx-value are normally distributed about the line. This implies that there are
morey-values scattered closer to the line than are scattered farther away. Assumption (1) implies that
these normal distributions are centered on the line: the means of these normal distributions ofy-values lie
on the line.
3.The standard deviations of the populationy-values about the line are equal for each value ofx. In other
words, each of these normal distributions ofy-values has the same shape and spread about the line.
4.The residual errors are mutually independent (no pattern).
5.The data are produced from a well-designed, random sample or randomized experiment.
Figure14.5Best-Fit LineThey-values for eachx-value are normally distributed about the line with the same standard deviation. For
eachx-value, the mean of they-values lies on the regression line. Morey-values lie near the line than are scattered further away
from the line.

Using Excel:To calculate the slope andy-intercept of the linear model, start by entering the (x, y) data in two
columns in Excel. Then the Excel commands =SLOPE and =INTERCEPT can be used to calculate the slope and

To calculate the slope of the regression model, use the Excel command
=SLOPE(y-data range,x-data range)
It’s important to note that this Excel command expects that they-data range is entered first and thex-data
range is entered second. Since revenue depends on amount spent on advertising, revenue is considered the
y-variable and amount spent on advertising is considered thex-variable. Notice they-data is contained in cells
C2 through C13 and thex-data is contained in cells B2 through B13. Thus the Excel command for slope would
be entered as
=SLOPE(C2:C13, B2:B13)
In the same way, the Excel command to calculate they-intercept of the regression model is
=INTERCEPT(y-data range,x-data range)

For the data set shown in the above table, the Excel command would be

Interpret and Apply the Slope andy-Intercept
The slope of the line,b, describes how changes in the variables are related. It is important to interpret the
slope of the line in the context of the situation represented by the data. You should be able to write a sentence
interpreting the slope in plain English.
Interpretation of the Slope
The slope of the best-fit line tells us how the dependent variable (y) changes for every one unit increase in the
independent (x) variable, on average.
In the previous example, the linear regression model for the monthly amount spent on advertising and the
monthly revenue for a Fortune 500 company for 12 months was generated as follows:
Since the slope was determined to be 61.8, the company can interpret this to mean that for every $1,000
dollars spent on advertising, on average, this will result in an increase in revenues of $61,800.
The intercept of the regression equation is the correspondingy-value when.
Interpretation of the Intercept
The intercept of the best-fit line tells us the expected mean value ofyin the case where thex-variable is equal
to zero.
However, in many scenarios it may not make sense to have thex-variable equal zero, and in these cases, the
43014 • Regression Analysis in Finance
Access for free at openstax.org

intercept does not have any meaning in the context of the problem. In other examples, thex-value of zero is
outside the range of thex-data that was collected. In this case, we should not assign any interpretation to the
y-intercept.
In the previous example, the range of data collected for thex-variable was from $49 to $153 spent per month
on advertising. Since this interval does not include anx-value of zero, we would not provide any interpretation
for the intercept.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate the regression model for a single independent variable as applied to financial forecasting.
•Extract measures ofslopeandinterceptfrom regression analysis in financial applications.
Regression Model for a Single Independent Variable
Regression analysis is used extensively in finance-related applications. Many typical applications involve
determining if there is a correlation between various stock market indices such as the S&P 500, theDow Jones
Industrial Average (DJIA), and the Russell 2000 index.
As an example, suppose we would like to determine if there is a correlation between the Russell 2000 index
and the DJIA. Does the value of the Russell 2000 index depend on the value of theDJIA? Is it possible to predict
the value of the Russell 2000 index for a certain value of the DJIA? We can explore these questions using
regression analysis.
Table 14.6shows a summary of monthly closing prices of the DJIA and the Russell 2000 for a 12-month time
period. We consider the DJIA to be the independent variable and the Russell 2000 index to be the dependent
variable.

The first step is to create a scatter plot to determine if the data points appear to follow a linear pattern. The
scatter plot is shown inFigure 14.7. The scatter plot clearly shows a linear pattern; the next step is to calculate
14.4 • Regression Applications in Finance431

the correlation coefficient and determine if the correlation is significant.
•Using the Excel command =CORREL, the correlation coefficient is calculated to be 0.947. This value of the
correlation coefficient is significant using the test for significance referenced earlier inCorrelation
Analysis.
•Using the Excel commands =SLOPE and =INTERCEPT, the value of the slope andy-intercept are calculated
as 0.11 and, respectively, when rounded to two decimal places.
The Excel output is shown below:
=CORREL(C3:C14,B3:B14): 0.947
=SLOPE(C3:C14,B3:B14): 0.113
=INTERCEPT(C3:C14,B3:B14): -1,496.340

Based on these results, the corresponding linear regression model is
Assume the DJIA has reached a value of 32,000. Predict the corresponding value of the Russell 2000 index. To
determine this, substitute the value of the independent variable,(this is the given value of the
DJIA), and calculate the corresponding value for the dependent variable, which is the predicted value for the
Russell 2000 index:
Thus the predicted value for the Russell 2000 index is approximately 2,024 when the DJIA reached a value of
32,000.
Measures of Slope and Intercept from Regression Analysis
An important application of regression analysis is to determine the systematic risk for a particular stock, which
is referred to asbeta. A stock’s beta is a measure of the volatility of the stock compared to a benchmark such
as the S&P 500 index. If a stock has more volatility compared to the benchmark, then the stock will have a beta
greater than 1.0. If a stock has less volatility compared to the benchmark, then the stock will have a beta less
43214 • Regression Analysis in Finance
Access for free at openstax.org

than 1.0.
Beta can be determined as the slope of the regression line when the stock returns are plotted versus the
returns for the benchmark, such as the S&P 500. As an example, consider the calculation for beta of Nike stock
based on monthly returns of Nike stock versus monthly returns for the S&P 500 over the time period from May
2020 to March 2021. The monthly return data is shown inTable 14.7.

14.5Predictions and Prediction Intervals
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate predictions for the dependent variable using the regression model.
•Generate prediction intervals based on a prediction for the dependent variable.
Predicting the Dependent Variable Using the Regression Model
A key aspect of generating the linear regression model is to use the model for predictions, provided the
correlation is significant. To generate predictions or forecasts using the linear regression model, substitute the
value of the independent variable (x) in the regression equation and solve the equation for the dependent
variable (y).
In a previous example, the linear regression equation was generated to relate the amount of monthly revenue
for aFortune 500company to the amount of monthly advertising spend. From the previous example, it was
determined that the regression equation can be written as
wherexrepresents the amount spent on advertising (in thousands of dollars) andyrepresents the amount of
43414 • Regression Analysis in Finance
Access for free at openstax.org

revenue (in thousands of dollars).
Let’s assume the Fortune 500 company would like to predict the monthly revenue for a month where it plans
to spend $80,000 for advertising. To determine the estimate of monthly revenue, letin the regression
equation and calculate a corresponding value for ŷ:
This predicted value ofyindicates that the forecasted revenue would be $14,320,700, assuming an advertising
spend of $80,000.
•Excel can provide this forecasted value directly using the =FORECAST command.
•To use this command, enter the value of the independent variablex, followed by the cell range for the
y-data and the cell range for thex-data, as follows:=FORECAST(X_VALUE, Range of Y-DATA, Range
of X-DATA)
•Using this Excel command, the forecasted value for the revenue is $14,320.52 when the advertising spend
is $80 (in thousands of dollars) (seeFigure 14.9). (Note: The discrepancy in the more precise Excel result
and the formula result is due to rounding in interim calculations.)
Figure14.9Revenue versus Advertising for Fortune 500 Company ($000s) Showing FORECAST Command in Excel
A word of caution when predicting values fory: it is generally recommended to only predict values foryusing
values ofxthat are in the original range of the data collection.
As an example, assume we have developed a linear model to predict the height of male children based on
their age. We have collected data for the age range fromyears old toyears old, and we have
confirmed that the scatter plot shows a linear trend and that the correlation is significant.
It would be erroneous to use this model to predict the height of a 25-year-old male sinceis outside the
range of thex-data, which was from 3 to 10 years old. The reason this is not recommended is that a linear
pattern cannot be assumed to continue beyond thex-value of 10 years old unless some data collection has
occurred at ages greater than 10 to confirm that the linear pattern is consistent forx-values beyond 10 years
14.5 • Predictions and Prediction Intervals435

old.
Generating Prediction Intervals
One important value of an estimated regression equation is its ability to predict the effects onyof a change in
one or more values of the independent variables. The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made
without estimates of the effects that may result. Indeed, it is the desire for particular results that drive the
formation of most policy. Regression models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.
Remember that point estimates do not carry a particular level of probability, or level of confidence, because
points have no “width” above which there is an area to measure. There are actually two different approaches
to the issue of developing estimates of changes in the independent variable (or variables) on the dependent
variable. The first approach wishes to measure the expected mean value ofyfrom a specific change in the
value ofx.
The second approach to estimate the effect of a specific value ofxonytreats the event as a single experiment:
you choosexand multiply it times the coefficient, and that provides a single estimate ofy. Because this
approach acts as if there were a single experiment, the variance that exists in the parameter estimate is larger
than the variance associated with the expected value approach.
The conclusion is that we have two different ways to predict the effect of values of the independent variable(s)
on the dependent variable, and thus we have two different intervals. Both are correct answers to the question
being asked, but there are two different questions. To avoid confusion, the first case where we are asking for
the expected value of the mean of the estimatedyis called aconfidence interval. The second case, where we
are asking for the estimate of the impact on the dependent variableyof a single experiment using a value ofx,
is called theprediction interval.
The prediction interval for an individualyforcan be calculated as
wheres
e
is the standard deviation of the error term,s
x
is the standard deviation of thex-variable, andis
the critical value of the t-distribution at theconfidence level.
Tabulated values of the t-distribution are available in online references such as theEngineering Statistics
Handbook(https://openstax.org/r/engineering_handbook). The mathematical computations for prediction
intervals are complex, and usually the calculations are performed using software. The formula above can be
implemented in Excel to create a 95% prediction interval for the forecast for monthly revenue when
is spent on monthly advertising.Figure 14.10shows the detailed calculations in Excel to arrive at a
95% prediction interval of (13,270.95, 15,370.09) for the monthly revenue. (The commands refer to the Excel
data table shown inFigure 14.9.)
43614 • Regression Analysis in Finance
Access for free at openstax.org

Figure14.10Calculations for 95% Prediction Interval for Monthly Revenue
This prediction interval can be interpreted as follows: there is 95% confidence that when the amount spent on
monthly advertising is $80,000, the corresponding monthly revenue will be between $13,270.95 and
$15,370.09.
Various computer regression software packages provide programs within the regression functions to provide
answers to inquiries of estimated predicted values ofygiven various values chosen for thex-variable(s). For
example, the statistical program R provides these prediction intervals directly. It is important to know just
which interval is being tested in the computer package because the difference in the size of the standard
deviations will change the size of the interval estimated. This is shown inFigure 14.11.
Figure14.11Prediction and Confidence Intervals for Regression Equation at 95% Confidence Level
Figure 14.11shows visually the difference the standard deviation makes in the size of the estimated intervals.
The confidence interval, measuring the expected value of the dependent variable, is smaller than the
prediction interval for the same level of confidence. The expected value method assumes that the experiment
is conducted multiple times rather than just once, as in the other method. The logic here is similar, although
not identical, to that discussed when developing the relationship between the sample size and the confidence
interval using the central limit theorem. There, as the number of experiments increased, the distribution
14.5 • Predictions and Prediction Intervals437

narrowed, and the confidence interval became tighter around the expected value of the mean.
It is also important to note that the intervals around a point estimate are highly dependent upon the range of
data used to estimate the equation, regardless of which approach is being used for prediction. Remember that
all regression equations go through the point of means—that is, the mean value ofyand the mean values of
all independent variables in the equation. As the value ofxgets further and further from the (x, y) point
corresponding to the mean value ofxand the mean value ofy, the width of the estimated interval around the
point estimate increases. Choosing values ofxbeyond the range of the data used to estimate the equation
poses an even greater danger of creating estimates with little use, very large intervals, and risk of error.Figure
14.12shows this relationship.
Figure14.12Confidence Interval for an Individual Value ofx,, at 95% Confidence Level
Figure 14.12demonstrates the concern for the quality of the estimated interval, whether it is a prediction
interval or a confidence interval. As the value chosen to predicty,in the graph, is further from the central
weight of the data,, we see the interval expand in width even while holding constant the level of confidence.
This shows that the precision of any estimate will diminish as one tries to predict beyond the largest weight of
the data and most certainly will degrade rapidly for predictions beyond the range of the data. Unfortunately,
this is just where most predictions are desired. They can be made, but the width of the confidence interval may
be so large as to render the prediction useless.

Generate Correlation Coefficients Using the R Statistical Tool
Ris an open-source statistical analysis tool that is widely used in the finance industry. R is available as a free
program and provides an integrated suite of functions for data analysis, graphing, and statistical
programming. R provides many functions and capabilities for regression analysis.
Recall that most calculations in R are handled via functions.
The typical method for using functions in statistical applications is to first create a vector of data values. There
are several ways to create vectors in R. For example, the c function is often used to combine values into a
vector. For example, this R command will generate a vector called salaries, containing the data values 40,000,
50,000, 75,000, and 92,000:

Create two vectors in R, one vector for the S&P 500 returns and a second vector for Coca-Cola returns:
> SP500 <- c(8,1,0,2,-3,7,4)
> CocaCola <- c(6,0,-2,1,-1,8,2)
The R command calledcorreturns the correlation coefficient for thex-data vector andy-data vector:
> cor(SP500, CocaCola)
Generate Linear Regression Models Using the R Statistical Tool
To create a linear model in R, assuming the correlation is significant, the commandlm(for linear model) will
provide the slope andy-intercept for the linear regression equation.
The format of the R command is
lm(dependent_variable_vector ~ independent_variable_vector)
Notice the use of the tilde symbol as the separator between the dependent variable vector and the
independent variable vector.
We use the returns on Coca-Cola stock as the dependent variable and the returns on the S&P 500 as the
independent variable, and thus the R command would be

In this output, they-intercept and slope is given, as well as the residuals for eachx-value. The output includes
additional statistical details regarding the regression analysis.
Predicted values and prediction intervals can also be generated within R.
First, we can create a structure in R called a data frame to hold the values of the independent variable for
which we want to generate a prediction. For example, we would like to generate the predicted return for Coca-
Cola stock, given that the return for the S&P 500 is 6.
We use the R command calledpredict.
To generate a prediction for the linear regression equation calledmodel, using the data frame where the value
of the S&P 500 is 6, the R commands will be
> a <- data.frame(SP500=6)
> predict(model, a)
1
4.839062
The output from thepredictcommand indicates that the predicted return for Coca-Cola stock will be 4.8%
when the return for the S&P 500 is 6%.
We can extend this analysis to generate a 95% prediction interval for this result by using the following R
command, which adds an option to thepredictcommand to generate a prediction interval:
> predict(model,a, interval="predict")
fit lwr upr
1 4.839062 0.05417466 9.62395
Thus the 95% prediction interval for Coca-Cola return is (0.05%, 9.62%) when the return for the S&P 500 is 6%.

Summary
14.1Correlation Analysis
Correlation is the measure of association between two numeric variables. A correlation coefficient calledris
used to assess the strength and direction of the correlation. The value ofris always betweenand. The
size of the correlationrindicates the strength of the linear relationship between the two variables. Values ofr
close toor toindicate a stronger linear relationship. A positive value ofrmeans that whenxincreases,y
tends to increase and whenxdecreases,ytends to decrease (positive correlation). A negative value ofrmeans
that whenxincreases,ytends to decrease and whenxdecreases,ytends to increase (negative correlation).
14.2Linear Regression Analysis
Linear regression analysis uses a straight-line fit to model the relationship between the two variables. Once a
straight-line model is developed, this model can then be used to predict the value of the dependent variable
for a specific value of the independent variable. Two parameters are calculated for the linear model, the slope
of the best-fit line and they-intercept of the best-fit line. The method of least squares is used to generate
these parameters; this method is based on minimizing the squared differences between the predicted values
and observed values fory.
14.3Best-Fit Linear Model
Once a correlation has been deemed significant, a linear regression model is developed. The goal in the
regression analysis is to determine the coefficientsaandbin the following regression equation:.
Typically some technology, such as Excel, R statistical tool, or a calculator, is used to generate the coefficientsa
andbsince manual calculations are cumbersome.
14.4Regression Applications in Finance
Regression analysis is used extensively in finance-related applications. Many typical applications involve
determining if there is a correlation between various stock market indices such as the S&P 500, the DJIA, and
the Russell 2000 index. The procedure is to first generate a scatter plot to determine if a visual trend is
observed, then calculate a correlation coefficient and check for significance. If the correlation coefficient is
significant, a linear model can then be generated and used for predictions.
14.5Predictions and Prediction Intervals
A key aspect of generating the linear regression model is to then use the model for predictions, provided that
the correlation is significant. To generate predictions or forecasts using the linear regression model, substitute
the value of the independent variable (x) in the regression equation and solve the equation for the dependent
variable (y). When making predictions using the linear model, it is generally recommended to only predict
values foryusing values ofxthat are in the original range of the data collection.
14.6Use of R Statistical Analysis Tool for Regression Analysis
R is an open-source statistical analysis tool that is widely used in the finance industry andcan be found online
(https://openstax.org/r/finance_industry). R provides an integrated suite of functions for data analysis,
graphing, and correlation and regression analysis. R is increasingly being used as a data analysis and statistical
tool because it is an open-source language and additional features are constantly being added by the user
community. The tool can be used on many different computing platforms.

Why It Matters
Having finished her college degree and embarked on her career, Maria is now contemplating her financial
future. She is considering how she might invest some of her hard-earned money. As a short-term goal, she
wants to build an emergency fund so that she could cover her expenses for six months if she became ill or
injured and had to take time off of work. She would also like to save money for a down payment on a home
and to purchase new furniture. Although she is not yet 30 years old, Maria also knows that it is prudent to
begin saving for retirement.
What should she do with her savings? Maria has some friends who have told her how successful they have
been investing in stocks. Bart bragged about doubling his money in just over a year when he purchased
Facebook stock, and Tiffany quickly tripled her money when she purchased shares in Netflix. But Maria also
knows that her uncle lost a significant amount of money when his Boeing stock dropped from over $300 per
share to under $150 within a couple of months at the beginning of 2020. Just how risky would it be to invest in
stocks? What type of return might Maria expect? Are there strategies she could follow that would allow her to
avoid her uncle’s fate?

15.1Risk and Return to an Individual Asset
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Compute the realized return from an individual investment.
•Compute the average return and volatility of returns from historical data.
•Describe firm-specific risk.
Measuring Historical Returns
Riskandreturnare often referred to as the two Rs of finance. Investors are interested in both risk and return
because understanding one without the other is really meaningless. In terms of investment, the concept of
returnis fairly straightforward; return is the benefit, or profit, the investor expects from an expenditure. It is
the reward for investing—the reason an investment is made in the first place. However, no investment is a
sure thing. The return may not be what the investor was expecting. This uncertainty about what the return will
be is referred to asrisk.
We begin by looking at how to measure both risk and return when considering an individual asset, such as one
stock. If your grandparents bought 100 shares ofApple, Inc.stock for you when you were born, you are
interested in knowing how well that investment has done. You may even want to compare how that
investment has fared to how an investment in a different stock, perhapsDisney, would have done. You are
interested in measuring the historical return.
Individual Investment Realized Return
Therealized returnof an investment is the total return that occurs over a particular time period. Suppose that
you purchased a share ofTarget (TGT)at the beginning of January 2020 for $128.74. At the end of the year, you
sold the stock for $176.53, which was $47.79 more than you paid for it. This increase in value is known as a
capital gain. As the owner of the stock, you also received $2.68 in dividends during 2020. Thetotal dollar return
from your investment is calculated as
It is common to express investment returns in percentage terms rather than dollar terms. This allows you to
answer the question “How much do I receive for each dollar invested?” so that you can compare investments
of different sizes. Thetotal percent returnfrom your investment is
Thedividend yieldis calculated by dividing the dividends you received by the initial stock price. This
calculation says that for each dollar invested in TGT in 2020, you received $0.0208 in dividends. Thecapital
gain yieldis the change in the stock price divided by the initial stock price. This calculation says that for each
dollar invested in TGT in 2020, you received $0.3712 in capital gains. Your total percent return of 39.20% means
that you made $0.392 for every dollar invested when your gains from both dividends and stock price
appreciation are totaled together.

per share, and sold the stock at the end of the year for $169.72 per share. Calculate your total dollar return,
your dividend yield, your capital gain yield, and your total percent yield.
Solution:
Because you purchased 10 shares, you receivedin dividend income. You spent
to purchase the stock, and you sold it forYour total
dollar return is
Your dividend yield is, or 3.38%, and your capital gain yield is
or 3.02%. Your total percent return is
Notice that you sold MMM for a price lower than what you paid for it at the beginning of the year. Your
capital gain is negative, or what is often referred to as acapital loss. Although the price fell, you still had a
positive total dollar return because of the dividend income.
Of course, investors seldom purchase a stock and then sell it exactly one year later. Assume that you
purchased shares ofFacebook (FB)on June 1, 2020, for $228.50 per share and sold the shares three months
later for $261.90. You received no dividends. In this case, yourholding period percentage returnis calculated
as
This 14.62% is your return for a three-month holding period. To compare them to other investment
opportunities, you need to express returns on a per-year, orannualized, basis. The holding period returned is
converted to aneffective annual rate (EAR)using the formula
wheremis the number of holding periods in a year.
There are four three-month periods in a year. So, the EAR for this investment is
What happens if you own a stock for more than one year? Your holding period return would have occurred
over a period longer than a year, but the process to calculate the EAR is the same. Suppose you purchased
shares of FB in May 2015, when it was selling for $79.30 per share. You held the stock until May 2020, when you
sold it for $224.59. Your holding period percentage return would be. You more
than tripled your money, but it took you five years to do so. Your EAR, which will be smaller than this five-year
holding period return rate, is calculated as
Average Annual Returns
Suppose that you purchased shares ofDelta Airlines (DAL)at the beginning of 2011 for $11.19 and held the
stock for 10 years before selling it for $40.21. You madeon your investment over
a 10-year period. This is a 259.34% holding period return. The EAR for this investment is
15.1 • Risk and Return to an Individual Asset451

To calculate the EAR using the above formula, the holding period return must first be calculated. The holding
period return represents the percentage return earned over the entire time the investment is held. Then the
holding period return is converted to an annual percentage rate using the formula.
You can also use the basic time value of money formula to calculate the EAR on an investment. In time value of
money language, the initial price paid for the investment, $11.19, is the present value. The price the stock is
sold for, $40.21, is the future value. It takes 10 years for the $11.19 to grow to $40.21. Using the time value of
money will result in a calculation of
The EAR formula and the time value of money both result in a 13.65% annual return. Mathematically, the two
formulas are the same; one is simply an algebraic rearrangement of the other.
If you earned 13.65% each year, compounded for 10 years, you would have converted your $11.19 per share
investment to $40.21 per share. Of course, DAL stock did not increase by exactly 13.65% each year. The returns
for DAL for each year are shown inTable 15.1. Some years, the return was much higher than 13.65%. In 2013,
the return was almost 133%! Other years, the return was much lower than 13.65%; in fact, in the return was
negative in four of the years.

Value of Initial Investment at Each Year End
Although an investment in DAL of $11.19 at the beginning of 2011 grew to $40.20 by the end of 2020, this
growth was not consistent each year. The amount that the stock was worth at the end of each year is also
shown inTable 15.1. During 2011, the return for DAL was −35.79%, resulting in the value of the investment
falling to. The following year, 2012, the return for DAL was 46.72%.
Therefore, the value of the investment wasat the end of 2012. This
process continues each year that the stock is held.

geometric average return. A geometric average return is calculated using the formula

difference in the geometric average return of 13.64% from the 13.65% derived from the EAR and time value of

Table15.2Yearly Returns for DAL, 2011–2020, with Calculation of the
Arithmetic Mean, Standard Deviation, and Geometric Mean
Looking atTable 15.2, you will notice that the geometric average return differs from the mean return. Adding
each of the annual returns and dividing the sum by 10 results in a 22.4% average annual return. This 22.4% is
called thearithmetic average return.
The geometric average return will be smaller than the arithmetic average return (unless the returns for all
years are identical). This is due to the basic arithmetic of compounding. Think of a very simple example in
which you invest $100 for two years. If you have a positive return of 50% the first year and a negative 50%
return the second year, you will have an arithmetic average return of, but you will have a
geometric average return of. With a 50% positive return the
first year, you ended the year with $150. The second year, you lost 50% of that balance and were left with only
$75.
Another important fact when studying average returns is that the order in which you earn the returns is not
important. Consider what would have occurred if the returns in the two years were reversed, so that you faced
a loss of 50% in the first year of your investment and a gain of 50% in the second year of your investment. With
a −50% return in the first year, you would have ended that year with only $50. Then, if that $50 earned a
positive 50% return the second year, you would have a $75 balance at the end of the two-year period. A
negative return of 50% followed by a positive return of 50% still results in an arithmetic average return of 0%
and a geometric average return of.

The arithmetic average return for CVS was 11.11%, and the geometric average return was 9.29%.
Both the arithmetic average return and the geometric average return are “correct” calculations. They simply
answer different questions. The geometric average tells you what you actually earned per year on average,
compounded annually. It is useful for calculating how much a particular investment grows over a period of
time. The arithmetic average tells you what you earned in a typical year. When we are looking at the historical
description of the distribution of returns and want to predict what to expect in a particular year, the arithmetic
average is the relevant calculation.
Measuring Risk
Although the arithmetic average return forDelta Airlines (DAL)for 2011–2020 was 22.4%, there is not a year in
which the return was exactly 22.4%. In fact, in some years, the return was much higher than the average, such
as in 2013, when it was 132.61%. In other years, the return was negative, such as 2011, when it was −35.79%.
Looking at the yearly returns inTable 15.2, the return for DAL varies widely from year to year. In finance, this
volatility of returns is considered risk.
Volatility of Returns
The most commonly used measure of volatility of returns in finance is the standard deviation of the returns.
The standard deviation of returns for DAL for the sample period 2011–2020 is 51.9%. Remember that if the
normal distribution (a bell−shaped curve) describes returns, then 68% (or about two-thirds) of the time, the
return in a particular year will be within one standard deviation above and one standard deviation below the
arithmetic average return. Given DAL’s average return of 22.4%, the actual yearly return will be somewhere
between −29.5% and 74.29% in two out of three years. A very high return of greater than 74.29% would occur
16% of the time; a very large loss of more than 29.5% would also occur 16% of the time.
As you can see, there is a wide range of what can be considered a “typical” year for DAL. Although we can
calculate an average return, the return in any particular year is likely to vary from that average. The larger the
standard deviation, the greater this range of returns is. Thus, a larger standard deviation indicates a greater
volatility of returns and, hence, more risk.

Table15.5Standard Deviation of CVS Returns
The standard deviation of returns for CVS during the sample period of 2011–2020 was 21.56%. With an
arithmetic average return of 11.11%, the return would lie between −10.45% and 32.67% in about two out of
three years. Even though the average return is 11.11%, a return in a particular year might be much higher
or much lower than that average. In fact, a loss of more than 10.45% would be expected about once every
six years. Also, about once every six years, a return greater than 32.67% would be expected.
Firm-Specific Risk
Investors purchase a share of stock hoping that the stock will increase in value and they will receive a positive
return. You can see, however, that even with well-established companies such as ExxonMobil and CVS, returns
are highly volatile. Investors can never perfectly predict what the return on a stock will be, or even if it will be
positive.
The yearly returns for four companies—Delta Airlines (DAL),Southwest Airlines (LUV),ExxonMobil (XOM), and
CVS Health Corp. (CVS)—are shown inTable 15.6. Each of these stocks had years in which the performance was
much better or much worse than the arithmetic average. In fact, none of the stocks appear to have a typical
return that occurs year after year.

Figure 15.2contains a graph of the returns for each of these four stocks by year. In this graph, it is easy to see
that DAL and LUV both have more volatility, or returns that vary more from year to year, than do XOM or CVS.
This higher volatility leads to DAL and LUV having higher standard deviations of returns than XOM or CVS.
Figure15.2Yearly Returns for DAL, LUV, XOM, and CVS(data source: Yahoo! Finance)
Standard deviation is considered a measure of the risk of owning a stock. The larger the standard deviation of
a stock’s annual returns, the further from the average that stock’s return is likely to be in any given year. In
other words, the return for the stock is highly unpredictable. Although the return for CVS varies from year to
year, it is not subject to the wide swings of the returns for DAL or LUV.
Why are stock returns so volatile? The value of the stock of a company changes as the expectations of the
future revenues and expenses of the company change. These expectations may change due to a number of
events and new information. Good news about a company will tend to result in an increase in the stock price.
For example, DAL announcing that it will be opening new routes and flying to cities it has not previously
serviced suggests that DAL will have more customers and more revenue in future years. Or if CVS announces
that it has negotiated lower rent for many of its locations, investors will expect the expenses of the company to
fall, leading to more profits. Those types of announcements will often be associated with a higher stock price.
Conversely, if the pilots and flight attendants for DAL negotiate higher salaries, the expenses for DAL will
increase, putting downward pressure on profits and the stock price.

Diversification
So far, we have looked at the return and the volatility of an individual stock. Most investors, however, own
shares of stock in multiple companies. This collection of stocks is known as aportfolio. Let’s explore why it is
wise for investors to hold a portfolio of stocks rather than to pick just one favorite stock to own.
We saw that investors who owned DAL experienced an average annual return of 20.87% but also a large
standard deviation of 51.16%. Investors who used all their funds to purchase DAL stock did exceptionally well
during 2012–2014. But in 2020, those investors lost almost one-third of their money asCOVID-19caused a
sharp reduction in air travel worldwide. To protect against these extreme outcomes, investors practice what is
calleddiversification, or owning a variety of stocks in their portfolios.
Suppose, for example, you have saved $50,000 that you want to invest. If you purchased $50,000 of DAL stock,
you would not be diversified. Your return would depend solely on the return on DAL stock. If, instead, you used
$5,000 to purchase DAL stock and used the remaining $45,000 to purchase nine other stocks, you would be
diversifying. Your return would depend not only on DAL’s return but also on the returns of the other nine
stocks in your portfolio. Investors practice diversification to manage risk.
It is akin to the saying “Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket.” If you place all of your eggs in one basket
and that basket breaks, all of your eggs will fall and crack. If you spread your eggs out across a number of
baskets, it is unlikely that all of the baskets will break and all of your eggs will crack. One basket may break,
and you will lose the eggs in that basket, but you will still have your other eggs. The same idea holds true for
investing. If you own stock in a company that does poorly, perhaps even goes out of business, you will lose the
money you placed in that particular investment. However, with a diversified portfolio, you do not lose all your
money because your money is spread out across a number of different companies.

Table15.7Yearly Returns for DAL Versus a Two-Stock Portfolio
Containing DAL and LUV, XOM, or CVS(data source: Yahoo! Finance)
As investors diversify their portfolios, the volatility of one particular stock becomes less important. XOM has
good years with above-average returns and bad years with below-average (and even negative) returns, just
like DAL. But the years in which those above-average and below-average returns occur are not always the
same for the two companies. In 2014, for example, the return for DAL was greater than 80%, while the return
for XOM was negative. On the other hand, in 2011, when DAL had a return of −35.15%, XOM had a positive
return. When more than one stock is held, the gains in one stock can offset the losses in another stock,
washing away some of the volatility.
When an investor holds only one stock, that one stock’s volatility contributes 100% to the portfolio’s volatility.
When two stocks are held, the volatility of each stock contributes to the volatility of the portfolio. However, the
volatility of the portfolio is not simply the average of the volatility of each stock held independently. How
correlated the two stocks are, or how much they move together, will impact the volatility of the portfolio.
You will recall from our study of correlation inRegression Analysis in Financethat a correlation coefficient
describes how two variables move relative to each other. A correlation coefficient of 1 means that there is a
perfect, positive correlation between the two variables, while a correlation coefficient of −1 means that the two
variables move exactly opposite of each other. Stocks that are in the same industry will tend to be more
15.2 • Risk and Return to Multiple Assets459

strongly correlated than stocks that are in much different industries. During the 2011–2020 time period, the
correlation coefficient for DAL and LUV was 0.87, the correlation coefficient for DAL and XOM was 0.35, and the
correlation coefficient for DAL and CVS was 0.79. Combining stocks that are not perfectly positively correlated
in a portfolio decreases risk.
Notice that investors who owned DAL and LUV from 2011 to 2020 would have had a lower portfolio standard
deviation, but not much lower, than investors who just owned DAL. Because the correlation coefficient is less
than one, the standard deviation fell. However, because the two stocks are in the same industry and exposed
to many of the same economic issues, the correlation coefficient is relatively high, and combining those two
stocks provides only a small decrease in risk.
This is because, as airlines, DAL and LUV face many of the same market conditions. In years when the economy
is strong, the weather is good, fuel prices are low, and people are traveling a lot, both companies will do well.
When something such as bad weather conditions reduces the amount of air travel for several weeks, both
companies are harmed. By holding LUV in addition to DAL, investors can reduce exposure to risk that is
specific to DAL (perhaps a problem that DAL has with its reservation system), but they do not reduce exposure
to the risk associated with the airline industry (perhaps rising jet fuel prices). DAL and LUV tend to experience
positive returns in the same years and negative returns in the same years.
On the other hand, investors who added XOM to their portfolio saw a significantly lower standard deviation
than those who held just DAL. In years when jet fuel prices rise, harming the profits of both DAL and LUV, XOM
is likely to see high profits. Diversifying a portfolio across firms that are less correlated will reduce the
standard deviation of the portfolio more.

Portfolio Size and Risk
As you add more stocks to a portfolio, the volatility, or standard deviation, of the portfolio decreases. The
volatility of individual assets becomes less and less important. As we discussed earlier, the risk that is
associated with events related to a particular company is calledfirm-specific risk, or unsystematic, risk.
Examples of unsystematic risk would include a company facing a product liability lawsuit, a company inventing
a new product, or accounting irregularities being detected. Holding a portfolio of stocks means that if one
company you have invested in goes out of business because of poor management, you do not lose all your
savings because some of your money is invested in other companies. Portfolio diversification protects you
from being significantly impacted by unsystematic risk.
However, there is a level below which the portfolio risk does not drop, no matter how diversified the portfolio
becomes. The risk that never goes away is known assystematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of holding the
market portfolio.
We have talked about reasons why a firm’s returns might be volatile; for example, the firm discovering a new
technology or having a product liability lawsuit brought against it will impact that firm specifically. There are
also events that broadly impact the stock market. Changes in the Federal Reserve Bank’s monetary policy and

interest rates impact all companies. Geopolitical events, major storms, and pandemics can also impact the
entire market. Investors in stocks cannot avoid this type of risk. This unavoidable risk is the systematic risk that
investors in stocks have. This systematic risk cannot be eliminated through diversification.
In addition, as per research conducted by Meir Statman,
4
the standard deviation of a portfolio drops quickly as
the number of stocks in the portfolio increases from one to two or three (see Figure 2 illustration inthis
subsequent article by Statman(https://openstax.org/r/subsequent_Statman)for context). Increasing the size
of the portfolio decreases the standard deviation, and thus the risk, of the portfolio. However, as the portfolio
increases in size, the amount of risk reduced by adding one more stock to the portfolio will decrease. How
many stocks does an investor need for a portfolio to be well-diversified? There is not an exact number that all
financial managers agree on. A portfolio of 15 highly correlated stocks will offer less benefits of diversification
than a portfolio of 10 stocks with lower correlation coefficients. A portfolio that consists of American Airlines,
Spirit Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Jet Blue, along with a few other stocks, is
not very diversified because of the heavy concentration in the airline industry. The termdiversified portfoliois
a relative concept, but the average investor can create a reasonably diversified portfolio with approximately a
dozen stocks.

•Define risk premium.
•Explain the concept of beta.
•Compute the required return of a security using the CAPM.
Risk-Free Rate
Thecapital asset pricing model (CAPM)is a financial theory based on the idea that investors who are willing
to hold stocks that have higher systematic risk should be rewarded more for taking on this market risk. The
CAPM focuses on systematic risk, rather than a stock’s individual risk, because firm-specific risk can be
eliminated through diversification.
Suppose that your grandparents have given you a gift of $20,000. After you graduate from college, you plan to
work for a few years and then apply to law school. You want to use the $20,000 your grandparents gave you to
pay for part of your law school tuition. It will be several years before you are ready to spend the money, and
you want to keep the money safe. At the same time, you would like to invest the money and have it grow until
you are ready to start law school.
Although you would like to earn a return on the money so that you have more than $20,000 by the time you
start law school, your primary objective is to keep the money safe. You are looking for a risk-free investment.
Lending money to the US government is considered the lowest-risk investment that you can make. You can
purchase a US Treasury security. The chances of the US government not paying its debts is close to zero.
Although, in theory, no investment is 100% risk-free, investing in US government securities is generally
considered a risk-free investment because the risk is so miniscule.

The rate that you can earn by purchasing US Treasury securities is a proxy for therisk-free rate. It is used as
an investing benchmark. The average rate of return for the three-month US Treasury security from 1928 to
2020 is 3.36%.
5
You can see that you will not become immensely wealthy by investing in US Treasury bills.
Another characteristic of US Treasury securities, however, is that their volatility tends to be much lower than
that of stocks. In fact, the standard deviation of returns for the US Treasury bills is 3.0%. Unlike the returns for
stocks, the return on US Treasury bills has never been negative. The lowest annual return was 0.03%, which
occurred in 2014.

more about US Treasury securities. You will find current interest rates for both short-term securities (US
Treasury bills) and long-term securities (US Treasury bonds).
Risk Premium
You know that if you use your $20,000 to invest in stock rather than in US Treasury bills, the outcome of the
investment will be uncertain. Your investments may do well, but there is also a risk of losing money. You will
only be willing to take on this risk if you are rewarded for doing so. In other words, you will only be willing to
take the risk of investing in stocks if you think that doing so will make you more than you would make
investing in US Treasury securities.
From 1928 to 2020, the average return for the S&P 500 stock index has been 11.64%, which is much higher
than the 3.36% average return for US Treasury bills.
7
Stock returns, with a standard deviation of 19.49%,
however, have also been much more volatile. In fact, there were 25 years in which the return for the S&P 500
index was negative.
You may not be willing to take the risk of losing some of the money your grandparents gave you because you
have been setting it aside for law school. If that’s the case, you will want to invest in US Treasury securities.
You may have money that you are saving for other long-term goals, such as retirement, with which you are
willing to take some risk. The extra return that you will earn for taking on risk is known as therisk premium.
The risk premium can be thought of as your reward for being willing to bear risk.
The risk premium is calculated as the difference between the return you receive for taking on risk and what
you would have returned if you did not take on risk. Using the average return of the S&P 500 (to measure what
investors who bear the risk earn) and the US Treasury bill rate (to measure what investors who do not bear
risk earn), the risk premium is calculated as
Beta
The risk premium represents how much an investor who takes on the market portfolio is rewarded for risk.
Investors who purchase one stock—DAL, for example—experience volatility, which is measured by the
standard deviation of that stock’s returns. Remember that some of that volatility, the volatility caused by firm-
specific risk, can be diversified away. Because investors can eliminate firm-specific risk through diversification,
they will not be rewarded for that risk. Investors are rewarded for the amount of systematic risk they incur.

Interpreting Beta
The relevant risk for investors is the systematic risk they incur. The systematic risk of a particular stock is
measured by how much the stock moves with the market. The measure of how much a stock moves with the
market is known as itsbeta. A stock that tends to move in sync with the market will have a beta of 1. For these
stocks, if the market goes up 10%, the stock generally also goes up 10%; if the market goes down 5%, stocks
with a beta of 1 also tend to go down 5%.
If a company has a beta greater than 1, then the stock tends to have a more pronounced move in the same
direction as a market move. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when
the market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.
Thus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered
to be riskier than the average stock.
On the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of
0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves. So,
if the market increases by 10%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would tend to rise by only 5%. A market decline of 5%
would tend to be associated with a 2.5% decrease in the stock.
Calculating Betas
The calculation of beta for DAL is demonstrated inFigure 15.3. Monthly returns for DAL and for the S&P 500
are plotted in the diagram. Each dot in the scatter plot corresponds to a month from 2018 to 2020; for
example, the dot that lies furthest in the upper right-hand corner represents November 2020. The return for
the S&P 500 was 10.88% that month; this return is plotted along the horizontal axis. The return for DAL during
November 2020 was 31.36%; this return is plotted along the vertical axis.
You can see that generally, when the overall stock market as measured by the S&P 500 is positive, the return
for DAL is also positive. Likewise, in months in which the return for the S&P 500 is negative, the return for DAL
is also usually negative. Drawing a line that best fits the data, also known as a regression line, summarizes the
relationship between the returns for DAL and the S&P 500. The slope of this line, 1.39, is DAL’s beta. Beta
measures the amount of systematic risk that DAL has.
Figure15.3Calculation of Beta for DAL(data source: Yahoo! Finance)
15.3 • The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)463

CAPM Equation
Because DAL’s beta of 1.39 is greater than 1, DAL is riskier than the average stock in the market. Finance
theory suggests that investors who purchase DAL will expect a higher rate of return to compensate them for
this risk. DAL has 139% of the average stock’s systematic risk; therefore, investors in the stock should receive
139% of themarket risk premium.

Calculating Beta
Many providers of stock data and investment information will list a company’s beta. Two internet sources
that can be used to find a company’s beta areYahoo! Finance(https://openstax.org/r/finance.yahoo)and
MarketWatch(https://openstax.org/r/marketwatch_search). Various sources may not provide the exact
same value for beta for a company. For example, in early February 2021,Yahoo! Financereported that the
beta for DAL was 1.46,
8
whileMarketWatchreported it as 1.29.

Both of these numbers are slightly
different from the 1.39 calculated in the graph above.
There are several reasons why beta may vary slightly from source to source. One is the time frame used in
the beta calculation. Data from three years were used to calculate the beta inFigure 15.3. Time frames
ranging from three to five years are commonly used when calculating beta. Another reason different
sources might report different betas is the frequency with which the data is collected. Monthly returns are
used inFigure 15.3; some analysts will use weekly data. Finally, the S&P 500 is used to measure the market
return inFigure 15.3; the S&P 500 is one of the most common measures of overall market returns, but
alternatives exist and are used by some analysts

Sharpe Ratio
Investors want a measure of how good a professional money manager is before they entrust their hard-
earned funds to that professional for investing. Suppose that you see an advertisement in whichMcKinley
Investment Managementclaims that the portfolios of its clients have an average return of 20% per year. You
know that this average annual return is meaningless without also knowing something about the riskiness of
the firm’s strategy. In this section, we consider some ways to evaluate the riskiness of an investment strategy.
A basic measure of investment performance that includes an adjustment for risk is theSharpe ratio. The
Sharpe ratiois computed as a portfolio’s risk premium divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio’s
return, using the formula
The portfolio risk premium is the portfolio returnR
P
minus the risk-free returnR
f
; this is the basic reward for
bearing risk. If the risk-free return is 3%, McKinley Investment Management’s clients who are earning 20% on
their portfolios have an excess return of 17%.
The standard deviation of the portfolio’s return,, is a measure of risk. Although you see that McKinley’s
clients earn a nice 20% return on average, you find that the returns are highly volatile. In some years, the
clients earn much more than 20%, and in other years, the return is much lower, even negative. That volatility
leads to a standard deviation of returns of 26%. The Sharpe ratio would be, or 0.65.
Thus, the Sharpe ratio can be thought of as a reward-to-risk ratio. The standard deviation in the denominator
can be thought of as the units of risk the investor has. The numerator is the reward the investor is receiving for
taking on that risk.

Sharpe Ratio
The Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate William F.Sharpe. You can visitSharpe’s Stanford
University website(https://openstax.org/r/stanford_wfsharpe)to find videos in which he discusses financial
topics and links to his research as well as his advice on how to invest.
Treynor Measurement of Performance
Another reward-to-risk ratio measurement of investment performance is theTreynor ratio. The Treynor ratio
is calculated as
Just as with the Sharpe ratio, the numerator of the Treynor ratio is a portfolio’s risk premium; the difference is
that the Treynor ratio focus focuses on systematic risk, using the beta of the portfolio in the denominator,
while the Shape ratio focuses on total risk, using the standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns in the
15.4 • Applications in Performance Measurement465

denominator.
If McKinley Investment Management has a portfolio with a 20% return over the past five years, with a beta of
1.2 and a risk-free rate of 3%, the Treynor ratio would be
Both the Sharpe and Treynor ratios are relative measures of investment performance, meaning that there is
not an absolute number that indicates whether an investment performance is good or bad. An investment
manager’s performance must be considered in relation to that of other managers or to a benchmark index.
Jensen’s Alpha
Jensen’s alphais another common measure of investment performance. It is computed as the raw portfolio
return minus the expected portfolio return predicted by the CAPM:
Suppose that the average market return has been 12%. What would Jensen’s alpha be for McKinley Investment
Management’s portfolio with a 20% average return and a beta of 1.2?
Unlike the Sharpe and Treynor ratios, which are meaningful in a relative sense, Jensen’s alpha is meaningful in
an absolute sense. An alpha of 0.062 indicates that the McKinley Investment Management portfolio provided a
return that was 6.2% higher than would be expected given the riskiness of the portfolio. A positive alpha
indicates that the portfolio had an abnormal return. If Jensen’s alpha equals zero, the portfolio return was
exactly what was expected given the riskiness of the portfolio as measured by beta.
THINK IT THROUGH
Comparing the Returns and Risks of Portfolios
You are interviewing two investment managers. Mr. Wong shows that the average return on his portfolio
for the past 10 years has been 14%, with a standard deviation of 8% and a beta of 1.2. Ms. Petrov shows that
the average return on her portfolio for the past 10 years has been 16%, with a standard deviation of 10%
and a beta of 1.6. You know that over the past 10 years, the US Treasury security rate has averaged 2% and
the return on the S&P 500 has averaged 11%. Which portfolio manager do you think has done the better
job?
Solution:
The Sharpe ratio for Mr. Wong’s portfolio is, and the Treynor ratio is. The
Sharpe ratio for Ms. Petrov’s portfolio is, and the Treynor ratio is.
Jensen’s alpha for Mr. Wong’s portfolio is
Jensen’s alpha for Ms. Petrov’s portfolio is
All three measures of portfolio performance suggest that Mr. Wong’s portfolio has performed better than
Ms. Petrov’s has. Although Ms. Petrov has had a larger average return, the portfolio she manages is riskier.
Ms. Petrov’s portfolio is more volatile than Mr. Wong’s, resulting in a higher standard deviation. Ms.
Petrov’s portfolio has a higher beta, which means it has a higher amount of systematic risk. The CAPM
suggests that a portfolio with a beta of 1.6 should have an expected return of 16.4%. Because Ms. Petrov’s
46615 • How to Think about Investing

portfolio has an average return of less than that, investors in Ms. Petrov’s portfolio are not rewarded for the
risk that they have taken as much as would be expected.

Average Return and Standard Deviation for a Single Stock
Excel can be used to calculate the average returns and the standard deviation of returns for both a single stock
and a portfolio of stocks. It can also be used to calculate the beta for a stock. Historic stock price data for
stocks you are interested in analyzing can easily be downloaded from sites such as Yahoo! Finance into Excel.
The examples in this section use monthly stock data from December 2017 to December 2020 from Yahoo!
Finance.
Monthly price data forAMZN (Amazon)is shown in column B ofFigure 15.4. To begin, monthly returns must be
calculated from the price data using the formula
The ending prices shown inFigure 15.4are the last price the stock traded for each month. Each month, the
return is calculated under the assumption that you purchased the stock at the last trading price of the
previous month and sold at the last price of the current month. Thus, the return for January 2018 is calculated
as
This is accomplished in Excel by placing the formula =(B3-B2)/B2 in cell C3. This formula can then be copied
down the spreadsheet through row C38. Now that each monthly return is in column C, you can calculate the
average of the monthly returns in cell C39 and the standard deviation of returns in cell C40.

Figure15.4Calculating the Average Return and the Standard Deviation of Returns for AMZN(data source: Yahoo! Finance)
Over the three-year period, the average monthly return for AMZN was 3.3%. However, this return was highly
volatile, with a standard deviation of 9.33%. Remember that this means that approximately two-thirds of the
time, the monthly return from AMZN was between −6.03% and 12.63%.

Average Return and Standard Deviation for a Portfolio
The Excel screenshot inFigure 15.5shows the return and standard deviation calculation for a portfolio. This
sample four-stock portfolio contains AMZN, CVS,AAPL (Apple), andNFLX (Netflix). This portfolio is constructed
as an equally weighted portfolio; because there are four stocks in this portfolio, each has a weight of 25%.

Figure15.5Calculation of the Average Return and Standard Deviation for a Portfolio(data source: Yahoo! Finance)
The monthly returns for each stock are recorded in their respective columns. The portfolio return for each
month is calculated as the weighted average of the four monthly individual stock returns. The formula for the
portfolio return is
The formula =$B$1*B3+$C$1*C3+$D$1*D3+$E$1*E3 is placed in cell F3. The formula is then copied down
column F to calculate the portfolio return for each month. After the monthly portfolio return is calculated, then
the average monthly portfolio return is calculated in cell F39. The average monthly portfolio return is 2.69%.
Because this is an equally weighted portfolio, with each of the four stocks impacting the portfolio return in the
same way, the average monthly portfolio return of 2.69% is the same as the sum of the average monthly
returns of the four stocks divided by four, or.
The standard deviation of the monthly portfolio returns is calculated in cell F40. This four-stock portfolio has a
standard deviation of 7.10%. Unlike the average return, this standard deviation is not equal to the average of
the standard deviations of returns of the four stocks. In fact, the standard deviation for the portfolio is less
than the standard deviation for any one of the four stocks. Remember that this occurs because the stock
returns are not perfectly positively correlated. The high return of one of the stocks in one month is dampened
by a lower return in another stock during the same month. Likewise, a negative return in one stock during a
month might be offset by a positive return in one of the other three stocks during the same month. This is the
risk reduction benefit of holding a portfolio of stocks.
Calculating Beta
The standard deviation of a stock’s returns indicates the stock’s volatility. Remember that the volatility is
caused by both firm-specific and systematic risk. Investors will not be rewarded for firm-specific risk because
15.5 • Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions469

they can diversify away from it. Investors are, however, rewarded for systematic risk. To determine how much
of a firm’s risk is due to systematic risk, you can use Excel to calculate the stock’s beta.
To calculate a stock’s beta, you need the monthly return for the market in addition to the monthly market
return for the stock. In column B inFigure 15.6, the monthly return forSPY, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust, is
recorded. SPY is an ETF that was created to mimic the performance of the S&P 500 index by State Street Global
Advisors and is often used as a proxy for the overall market performance. The monthly returns for AMZN are
visible in column C. It is important that these returns be lined up so that the returns for a particular month for
both securities appear in the same row number. Also, you want to place the returns for SPY in the column to
the left of the returns for AMZN so that when you create your graph, SPY will automatically appear on the
horizontal axis.

Selecting the scatter plot option will result in a chart being inserted that looks like the chart inFigure 15.7. Each

and the return for AMZN measured on the vertical axis. Consider, for example, the dot in the furthest upper
right-hand section of the figure. This dot is the plot of returns for the month of April 2020, when the return for
SPY was 13.36% (measured on the horizontal axis) and the return for AMZN was 26.89% (measured on the

for the best-fit line that shows how AMZN moves when the market moves. The slope of this line, 1.1477, is the
beta for AMZN. This tells you that for every 10% move the overall market makes, AMZN tends to move
11.477%. Because AMZN tends to move a little more than the broader market, it has a little more systematic
risk than the average stock in the market.

Summary
15.1Risk and Return to an Individual Asset
Investors are interested in both the return they can expect to receive when making an investment and the risk
associated with that investment. In finance, risk is considered the volatility of the return from time period to
time period. Historical returns are measured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the
standard deviation of returns.
15.2Risk and Return to Multiple Assets
As investors hold multiple assets in a portfolio, they are able to eliminate firm-specific risk. However,
systematic or market risk remains, even if an investor holds the market portfolio. The return to a portfolio is
measured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the returns of the
portfolio. The risk of the portfolio will be lower than the weighted average of the risk of the individual
securities because the returns of the securities are not perfectly correlated. A low or negative return for one
stock in a period can be offset by a high return for another stock in the same period.
15.3The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) relates the expected return of an asset to the systematic risk of that
asset. Investors will be rewarded for taking on systematic risk. They will not be rewarded for taking on firm-
specific risk, however, because that risk can be diversified away.
15.4Applications in Performance Measurement
Because investors are not simply interested in returns but are also interested in risk, the success of a portfolio
cannot be measured simply by considering the portfolio’s return. In order to compare investment portfolios,
risk and return must both be taken into consideration. The Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio are two
measures that provide a reward-to-risk measure of a portfolio. Jensen’s alpha provides a measure of the
abnormal return of a portfolio, considering the portfolio’s risk level.
15.5Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions
Using Excel to manipulate publicly available stock data makes calculating the average return of a stock and the
standard deviation of returns easy. The average return for a portfolio and the standard deviation of the
portfolio returns can also be calculated easily. By comparing the returns of a stock with the returns of the
overall market using Excel charting tools, the beta for a stock, which measures systematic risk, can be
determined.

Why It Matters
One of the most important decisions a company faces is choosing which investments it should make. Should
an automobile manufacturer purchase a new robot for its assembly line? Should an airline purchase a new
plane to add to its fleet? Should a hotel chain build a new hotel in Atlanta? Should a bakery purchase tables
and chairs to provide places for customers to eat? Should a pharmaceutical company spend money on
research for a new vaccine? All of these questions involve spending money today to make money in the future.
The process of making these decisions is often referred to ascapital budgeting. In order to grow and remain
competitive, a firm relies on developing new products, improving existing products, and entering new
markets. These new ventures require investments in fixed assets. The company must decide whether the
project will generate enough cash to cover the costs of these initial expenditures once the project is up and
running.
For example,Sam’s Sporting Goodssells sporting equipment and uniforms to players on local recreational and
school teams. Customers have been inquiring about customizing items such as baseball caps and equipment
bags with logos and other designs. Sam’s is considering purchasing an embroidery machine so that it can
provide these customized items in-house. The machine will cost $16,000. Purchasing the embroidery machine
would be an investment in a fixed asset. If it purchases the machine, Sam’s will be able to charge customers
for customization.

The managers think that selling customized items will allow the company to increase its cash flow by $2,000
next year. They predict that as customers become more aware of this service, the ability to customize products
in-house will increase the company’s cash flow by $4,000 the following year. The managers expect the
machine will be used for five years, with the embroidery products increasing cash flows by $5,000 during each
of the last three years the machine is used. Should Sam’s Sporting Goods invest in the embroidery machine?
In this chapter, we consider the main capital budgeting techniques Sam’s and other companies can use to
evaluate these types of decisions.
16.1Payback Period Method
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define payback period.
•Calculate payback period.
•List the advantages and disadvantages of using the payback period method.
The payback period method provides a simple calculation that the managers at Sam’s Sporting Goods can use
to evaluate whether to invest in the embroidery machine. Thepayback periodcalculation focuses on how
long it will take for a company to make enough free cash flow from the investment to recover the initial cost of
the investment.
Payback Period Calculation
In order to purchase the embroidery machine, Sam’s Sporting Goods must spend $16,000. During the first
year, Sam’s expects to see a $2,000 benefit from purchasing the machine, but this means that after one year,
the company will have spent $14,000 more than it has made from the project. During the second year that it
uses the machine, Sam’s expects that its cash inflow will be $4,000 greater than it would have been if it had not
had the machine. Thus, after two years, the company will have spent $10,000 more than it has benefited from
the machine. This process is continued year after year until the accumulated increase in cash flow is $16,000,
or equal to the original investment. The process is summarized inTable 16.1.

Balance ($)(16,000)(14,000)(10,000)(5,000)-5,000
Table16.1
Sam’s Sporting Goods is expecting its cash inflow to increase by $16,000 over the first four years of using the
embroidery machine. Thus, the payback period for the embroidery machine is four years. In other words, it
takes four years to accumulate $16,000 in cash inflow from the embroidery machine and recover the cost of
the machine.

Calculating the Payback Period
It is possible that a project will not fully recover the initial cost in one year but will have more than
recovered its initial cost by the following year. In these cases, the payback period will not be an integer but
48016 • How Companies Think about Investing
Access for free at openstax.org

will contain a fraction of a year. This video demonstrateshow to calculate the payback period
(https://openstax.org/r/how-to-calculate)in such a situation.
Advantages
The principal advantage of the payback period method is its simplicity. It can be calculated quickly and easily.
It is easy for managers who have little finance training to understand. The payback measure provides
information about how long funds will be tied up in a project. The shorter the payback period of a project, the
greater the project’s liquidity.
Disadvantages
Although it is simple to calculate, the payback period method has several shortcomings. First, the payback
period calculation ignores the time value of money. Suppose that in addition to the embroidery machine,
Sam’s is considering several other projects. The cash flows from these projects are shown inTable 16.2. Both
Project B and Project C have a payback period of five years. For both of these projects, Sam’s estimates that it
will take five years for cash inflows to add up to $16,000. The payback period method does not differentiate
between these two projects.
Year0123456
Project A ($)(16,000)2,0004,0005,0005,0005,0005,000
Project B ($)(16,000)1,0002,0003,0004,0006,000-
Project C ($)(16,000)6,0004,0003,0002,0001,000-
Project D ($)(16,000)1,0002,0003,0004,0006,0008,000
Table16.2
However, we know that money has a time value, and receiving $6,000 in year 1 (as occurs in Project C) is
preferable to receiving $6,000 in year 5 (as in Projects B and D). From what we learned about the time value of
money, Projects B and C are not identical projects. The payback period method breaks the important finance
rule of not adding or comparing cash flows that occur in different time periods.
A second disadvantage of using the payback period method is that there is not a clearly defined acceptance or
rejection criterion. When the payback period method is used, a company will set a length of time in which a
project must recover the initial investment for the project to be accepted. Projects with longer payback periods
than the length of time the company has chosen will be rejected. If Sam’s were to set a payback period of four
years, Project A would be accepted, but Projects B, C, and D have payback periods of five years and so would
be rejected. Sam’s choice of a payback period of four years would be arbitrary; it is not grounded in any
financial reasoning or theory. No argument exists for a company to use a payback period of three, four, five, or
any other number of years as its criterion for accepting projects.
A third drawback of this method is that cash flows after the payback period are ignored. Projects B, C, and D all
have payback periods of five years. However, Projects B and C end after year 5, while Project D has a large cash
flow that occurs in year 6, which is excluded from the analysis. The payback method is shortsighted in that it
favors projects that generate cash flows quickly while possibly rejecting projects that create much larger cash
flows after the arbitrary payback time criterion.
Fourth, no risk adjustment is made for uncertain cash flows. No matter how careful the planning and analysis,
a business is seldom sure what future cash flows will be. Some projects are riskier than others, with less
certain cash flows, but the payback period method treats high-risk cash flows the same way as low-risk cash
flows.

16.2Net Present Value (NPV) Method
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define net present value.
•Calculate net present value.
•List the advantages and disadvantages of using the net present value method.
•Graph an NPV profile.
Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation
Sam’s purchasing of the embroidery machine involves spending money today in the hopes of making more
money in the future. Because the cash inflows and outflows occur in different time periods, they cannot be
directly compared to each other. Instead, they must be translated into a common time period using time value
of money techniques. By converting all of the cash flows that will occur from a project into present value, or
current dollars, the cash inflows from the project can be compared to the cash outflows. If the cash inflows
exceed the cash outflows in present value terms, the project will add value and should be accepted. The
difference between the present value of the cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows is known as
net present value (NPV).
The equation for NPV can be written as
Consider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision of whether to purchase the embroidery machine. If we assume that
after six years the embroidery machine will be obsolete and the project will end, when placed on a timeline,
the project’s expected cash flow is shown inTable 16.3:
Year0123456
Cash Flow ($)(16,000)2,0004,0005,0005,0005,0005,000
Table16.3
Calculating NPV is simply a time value of money problem in which each cash flow is discounted back to the
present value. If we assume that the cost of funds for Sam’s is 9%, then the NPV can be calculated as
Because the NPV is positive, Sam’s Sporting Goods should purchase the embroidery machine. The value of the
firm will increase by $2,835.63 as a result of accepting the project.
Calculating NPV involves computing the present value of each cash flow and then summing the present values
of all cash flows from the project. This project has six future cash flows, so six present values must be
computed. Although this is not difficult, it is tedious.
A financial calculator is able to calculate a series of present values in the background for you, automating
much of the process. You simply have to provide the calculator with each cash flow, the time period in which
each cash flow occurs, and the discount rate that you want to use to discount the future cash flows to the
present.

This video provides another example ofhow to use NPV(https://openstax.org/r/how-to-use-NPV)to
evaluate whether a project should be accepted or rejected.
Advantages
The NPV method solves several of the listed problems with the payback period approach. First, the NPV
method uses the time value of money concept. All of the cash flows are discounted back to their present value
to be compared. Second, the NPV method provides a clear decision criterion. Projects with a positive NPV
should be accepted, and projects with a negative NPV should be rejected. Third, the discount rate used to
discount future cash flows to the present can be increased or decreased to adjust for the riskiness of the
project’s cash flows.
Disadvantages
The NPV method can be difficult for someone without a finance background to understand. Also, the NPV
method can be problematic when available capital resources are limited. The NPV method provides a criterion

Calculating NVP
Suppose your company is considering a project that will cost $30,000 this year. The cash inflow from this
project is expected to be $6,000 next year and $8,000 the following year. The cash inflow is expected to
increase by $2,000 yearly, resulting in a cash inflow of $18,000 in year 7, the final year of the project. You
know that your company’s cost of funds is 9%. Use a financial calculator to calculate NPV to determine
whether this is a good project for your company to undertake (seeTable 16.5).

Calculating the NPV of an MBA Program
The NPV calculation can be used as a decision tool when you are deciding whether you should spend
money today to make money in the future. This website oncalculating the NPV on an MBA degree
(https://openstax.org/r/calculating-the-NPV)lets you apply this concept in an educational setting. The
initial cost of the MBA includes both the dollars spent on tuition and the wages that a full-time student
could have earned if they were not in school. Why is it appropriate to include these forgone wages in the
calculation? What adjustments would students need to make to this analysis if they wanted to consider
attending a part-time MBA program that allowed them to continue working while completing the program?
NPV Profile
The NPV of a project depends on the expected cash flows from the project and the discount rate used to
translate those expected cash flows to the present value. When we used a 9% discount rate, the NPV of the
embroidery machine project was $2,836. If a higher discount rate is used, the present value of future cash
flows falls, and the NPV of the project falls.
Theoretically, we should use the firm’s cost to attract capital as the discount rate when calculating NPV. In
reality, it is difficult to estimate this cost of capital accurately and confidently. Because the discount rate is an
approximate value, we want to determine whether a small error in our estimate is important to our overall
conclusion. We can do this by creating an NPV profile, which graphs the NPV at a variety of discount rates and
allows us to determine how sensitive the NPV is to changes in the discount rate.
To construct an NPV profile for Sam’s, select several discount rates and compute the NPV for the embroidery
machine project using each of those discount rates.Table 16.6below shows the NPV for several discount rates.
Notice that if the discount rate is zero, the NPV is simply the sum of the cash flows. As the discount rate
becomes larger, the NPV falls and eventually becomes negative.
The information inTable 16.6is presented in a graph inFigure 16.2. We can see that the graph crosses the
horizontal axis at about 14%. To the left, or at lower discount rates, the NPV is positive. If you are confident
that the firm’s cost of attracting funds is less than 14%, the company should accept the project. If the cost of
capital is more than 14%, however, the NPV is negative, and the company should reject the project.

16.3Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define internal rate of return (IRR).
•Calculate internal rate of return.
•List advantages and disadvantages of using the internal rate of return method.
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Calculation
Theinternal rate of return (IRR)is the discount rate that sets the present value of the cash inflows equal to
the present value of the cash outflows. In considering whether Sam’s Sporting Goods should purchase the
embroidery machine, the IRR method approaches the time value of money problem from a slightly different
angle. Instead of using the company’s cost of attracting funds for the discount rate and solving for NPV, as we
did in the first NPV equation, we set NPV equal to zero and solve for the discount rate to find the IRR:
The IRR is the discount rate at which the NPV profile graph crosses the horizontal axis. If the IRR is greater
than the cost of capital, a project should be accepted. If the IRR is less than the cost of capital, a project should
be rejected. The NPV profile graph for the embroidery machine crossed the horizontal axis at 14%. Therefore,
if Sam’s Sporting Goods can attract capital for less than 14%, the IRR exceeds the cost of capital and the
embroidery machine should be purchased. However, if it costs Sam’s more than 14% to attract capital, the
embroidery machine should not be purchased.
In other words, a company wants to accept projects that have an IRR that exceed the company’s cost of
attracting funds. The cash flow from these projects will be great enough to cover the cost of attracting money
from investors in addition to the other costs of the project. A company should reject any project that has an
IRR less than the company’s cost of attracting funds; the cash flows from such a project are not enough to
compensate the investors for the use of their funds.
Calculating IRR without a financial calculator is an arduous, time-consuming process that requires trial and
error to find the discount rate that makes NPV exactly equal zero. Your calculator uses the same type of trial-
and-error iterative process, but because it uses an automated process, it can do so much more quickly than
you can. A problem that might require 30 minutes of detailed mathematical calculations by hand can be
48616 • How Companies Think about Investing
Access for free at openstax.org

completed in a matter of seconds with the assistance of a financial calculator.
All the information your calculator needs to calculate IRR is the value of each cash flow and the time period in
which it occurs. To calculate IRR, begin by entering the cash flows for the project, just as you do for the NPV
calculation (seeTable 16.7). After these cash flows are entered, simply compute IRR in the final step.

Table16.7Calculator Steps for IRR
Advantages
The primary advantage of using the IRR method is that it is easy to interpret and explain. Investors like to
speak in terms of annual percentage returns when evaluating investment possibilities.
Disadvantages
One disadvantage of using IRR is that it can be tedious to calculate. We knew the IRR was about 14% for the
embroidery machine project because we had previously calculated the NPV for several discount rates. The IRR
is about, but not exactly, 14%, because NPV is not exactly equal to zero (just very close to zero) when we use
14% as the discount rate. Before the prevalence of financial calculators and spreadsheets, calculating the exact
IRR was difficult and time-consuming. With today’s technology, this is no longer a major consideration. Later
in this chapter, we will look at how to use a spreadsheet to do these calculations.
No Single Mathematical Solution.Another disadvantage of using the IRR method is that there may not be a
single mathematical solution to an IRR problem. This can happen when negative cash flows occur in more than
one period in the project. Suppose your company is considering building a facility for an upcoming Olympic
competition. The construction cost would be $350 million. The facility would be used for one year and generate
cash inflows of $950 million. Then, the following year, your company would be required to convert the facility
into a public park area for the city, which is expected to cost $620 million. Placing these cash flows in a timeline
results in the following (Table 16.8):
16.3 • Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method487

Year012
Cash Flow ($Millions)(350)950(620)
Table16.8
The NPV profile for this project looks likeFigure 16.3. The NPV is negative at low interest rates, becomes
positive at higher interest rates, and then turns negative again as the interest rate continues to rise. Because
the NPV profile line crosses the horizontal axis twice, there are two IRRs. In other words, there are two interest
rates at which NPV equals zero.
Figure16.3NPV Profile Graph for a Project with Two IRRs
Reinvestment Rate Assumption.The IRR assumes that the cash flows are reinvested at the internal rate of
return when they are received. This is a disadvantage of the IRR method. The firm may not be able to find any
other projects with returns equal to a high-IRR project, so the company may not be able to reinvest at the IRR.
The reinvestment rate assumption becomes problematic when a company has several acceptable projects and
is attempting to rank the projects. We will look more closely at the issues that can arise when considering
mutually exclusive projects later in this chapter. If a company is simply deciding whether to accept a single
project, the reinvestment assumption limitation is not relevant.
Overlooking Differences in Scale.Another disadvantage of using the IRR method to choose among various
acceptable projects is that it ignores differences in scale. The IRR converts the cash flows to percentages and
ignores differences in the size or scale of projects. Issues that occur when comparing projects of different
scales are covered later in this chapter.
16.4Alternative Methods
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate profitability index.
•Calculate discounted payback period.
•Calculate modified internal rate of return.
Profitability Index (PI)
Theprofitability index (PI)uses the same inputs as the NPV calculation, but it converts the results to a ratio.
The numerator is the present value of the benefits of doing a project. The denominator is the present value of
48816 • How Companies Think about Investing
Access for free at openstax.org

the cost of doing the project. The formula for calculating PI is
For the embroidery machine project that Sam’s Sporting Goods is considering, the PI would be calculated as
The numerator of the PI formula is the benefit of the project, and the denominator is the cost of the project.
Thus, the PI is the benefit relative to the cost. When NPV is greater than zero, PI will be greater than 1. When
NPV is less than zero, PI will be less than 1. Therefore, the decision criterion using the PI method is to accept a
project if the PI is greater than 1 and reject a project if the PI is less than 1.
Note that the NPV method and the PI method of project evaluation will always provide the same answer to the
accept-or-reject question. The advantage of using the PI method is that it is helpful in ranking projects from
best to worst. Issues that arise when ranking projects are discussed later in this chapter.
Discounted Payback Period
The payback period method provides a fast, simple approach to evaluating a project, but it suffers from the
fact that it ignores the time value of money. Thediscounted payback periodmethod addresses this flaw by
discounting cash flows using the company’s cost of funds and then using these discounted values to
determine the payback period.
Consider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision regarding whether to purchase an embroidery machine. The
expected cash flows and their values when discounted using the company’s 9% cost of funds are shown in
Table 16.9. Earlier, we calculated the project’s payback period as four years; that is how long it would take the
company to recover all of the cash that it would spend on the project. Remember, however, that the payback
period does not consider the company’s cost of funds, so it underestimates the true breakeven time period.

Table16.9
When the cash flows are appropriately discounted, the project still has not broken even by the end of year 5.
The discounted payback period would beyears. This adjusted calculation addresses the
payback period method’s flaw of not considering the time value of money, but managers are still confronted
with the other disadvantages. No objective criterion for acceptance or rejection exists because of the lack of a
theoretical underpinning for what is an acceptable payback period length. The discounted payback period
ignores any cash flows after breakeven occurs; this is a serious drawback, especially when comparing mutually
exclusive projects.
Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)
Financial analysts have developed an alternative evaluation technique that is similar to the IRR but modified in
an attempt to address some of the weakness of the IRR method. Thismodified internal rate of return
(MIRR)is calculated using the following steps:
1.Find the present value of all of the cash outflows using the firm’s cost of attracting capital as the discount

rate.
2.Find the future value of all cash inflows using the firm’s cost of attracting capital as the discount rate. All
cash inflows are compounded to the point in time at which the last cash inflow will be received. The sum of
the future value of cash inflows is known as the project terminal value.
3.Compute the yield that sets the future value of the inflows equal to the present value of the outflows. This
yield is the modified internal rate of return.
For our embroidery machine project, the MIRR would be calculated as shown inTable 16.10:

final cash inflow. The sum of the future value of these six cash flows is $31,595.22. Thus, the terminal value
is $31,595.22
3.The interest rate that equates the present value of the outflows, $16,000, to the terminal value of
$31,595.22 six years later is found using the formula
The MIRR solves the reinvestment rate assumption problem of the IRR method because all cash flows are
compounded at the cost of capital. In addition, solving for MIRR will result in only one solution, unlike the IRR,
which may have multiple mathematical solutions. However, the MIRR method, like the IRR method, suffers
from the limitation that it does not distinguish between large-scale and small-scale projects. Because of this
limitation, the MIRR cannot be used to rank projects; it can only be used to make accept-or-reject decisions.

So far, we have considered methods for deciding to accept or to reject a single stand-alone project.
Sometimes, managers must make decisions regarding which of two projects to accept, or a company might be
faced with a number of good, acceptable projects and have to decide which of those projects to take on during

the current year.
Choosing between Mutually Exclusive Projects
Earlier in this chapter, we saw that the embroidery machine that Sam’s Sporting Goods was considering had a
positive NPV, making it a project that Sam’s should accept. However, another, more expensive embroidery
machine may be available that is able to make more stitches per minute. Although the initial cost of this heavy-
duty machine is higher, it would allow Sam’s to embroider and sell more items each year, generating more
revenue. The two embroidery machines aremutually exclusive projects. Mutually exclusive projects compete
with one another; purchasing one embroidery machine excludes Sam’s from purchasing the other embroidery
machine.
Table 16.11shows the cash outflow and inflows expected from the original embroidery machine considered as
well as the heavy-duty machine. The heavy-duty machine costs $25,000, but it will generate more cash inflows
in years 3 through 6. Both machines have a positive NPV, leading to decisions to accept the projects. Also, both
machines have an IRR exceeding the company’s 9% cost of raising capital, also leading to decisions to accept
the projects.
When considered by themselves, each of the machines is a good project for Sam’s to pursue. The question the
managers face is which is the better of the two projects. When faced with this type of decision, the rule is to
take the project with the highest NPV. Remember that the goal is to choose projects that add value to the
company. Because the NPV of a project is the estimate of how much value it will create, choosing the project
with the higher NPV is choosing the project that will create the greater value.

Olympic Project Economics
The investment analysis procedures used by companies are also used by government entities when
evaluating projects. Olympic host cities receive direct revenues from broadcast rights, ticket sales, and
licensing agreements. The cities also expect indirect benefits from increased tourism, including increased
employment and higher tax revenues. These benefits come after the city makes a major investment in
infrastructure, spending money on stadiums, housing, and transportation. The investment in infrastructure
for the2014 Winter OlympicsinSochi, Russia, was over $50 billion.

Choosing between Projects with Different Lives
Suppose you are considering starting an ice-cream truck business. You find that you can purchase a used truck
for $50,000. You estimate that the truck will last for three years, and you will be able to sell enough ice cream

treats to generate a cash inflow of $40,000 during each of those years. Your cost of capital is 10%. The positive
NPV of $49,474 for the project makes this an acceptable project.
Another ice-cream truck is also for sale for $50,000. This truck is smaller and will not be able to hold as many
frozen treats. However, the truck is newer, with lower mileage, and you estimate that you can use it for six
years. This newer truck will allow you to generate a cash inflow of $30,000 each year for the next six years. The
NPV of the newer truck is $80,658.
Because both trucks are acceptable projects but you can only drive one truck at a time, you must choose which
truck to purchase. At first, it may be tempting to purchase the newer, lower-mileage truck because of its
higher NPV. Unfortunately, when comparing two projects that have different lives, a decision cannot be made
simply by comparing the NPVs. Although the ice-cream truck with the six-year life span has a much higher NPV
than the larger truck, it consumes your resources for a long time.
There are two methods for comparing projects with different lives. Both assume that when the short-life
project concludes, another, similar project will be available.
Replacement Chain Approach
With thereplacement chain approach, as many short-life projects as necessary are strung together to equal
the life of the long-life project. You can purchase the newer, lower-mileage ice-cream truck and run your
business for six years. To make a comparison, you assume that if you purchase the larger truck that will last
for three years, you will be able to repeat the same project, purchasing another larger truck that will last for
the next three years. In essence, you are comparing a six-year project with two consecutive three-year projects
so that both options will generate cash inflows for six years. Your timeline for the projects (comparing an
older, larger truck with a newer, lower-mileage truck) will look likeTable 16.12:

Table16.12
The present values of all of the cash inflows and outflows from purchasing two of the older, larger trucks
consecutively are added together to find the NPV of that alternative. The NPV of this alternative is $86,645,
which is higher than the NPV of $80,658 of the newer truck, as shown inTable 16.13:

Table16.13
When using the replacement chain approach, the short-term project is repeated any number of times to equal
the length of the longer-term project. If one project is 5 years and another is 20 years, the short one is
49216 • How Companies Think about Investing
Access for free at openstax.org

repeated four times. This method can become tedious when the length of the longer project is not a multiple
of the shorter project. For example, when choosing between a five-year project and a seven-year project, the
short one would have to be duplicated seven times and the long project would have to be repeated five times
to get to a common length of 35 years for the two projects.
Equal Annuity Approach
Theequal annuity approachassumes that both the short-term and the long-term projects can be repeated
forever. This approach involves the following steps:
Step 1: Find the NPV of each of the projects.
•The NPV of the larger, older ice-cream truck is $49,474.
•The NPV of the smaller, newer ice-cream truck is $80,658.
Step 2: Find the annuity that has the same present value as the NPV and the same number of periods as the
project.
•For the larger, older ice-cream truck, we want to find the three-year annuity that would have a present
value of $49,474 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $19,894.
•For the smaller, newer ice-cream truck, we want to find the six-year annuity that would have a present
value of $80,658 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $18,520.
Step 3: Assume that these projects, or similar projects, can be repeated over and over and that these annuities
will continue forever. Calculate the present value of these annuities continuing forever using the perpetuity
formula.
We again find that the older, larger truck is preferred to the newer, smaller truck.
These methods correct for unequal lives, but managers need to be aware that some unavoidable issues come
up when these adjustments are made. Both the replacement chain and equal annuity approaches assume that
projects can be replicated with identical projects in the future. It is important to note that this is not always a
reasonable assumption; these replacement projects may not exist. Estimating cash flows from potential
projects is prone to errors, as we will discuss inFinancial Forecastingthese errors are compounded and
become more significant as projects are expected to be repeated. Inflation and changing market conditions
are likely to result in cash flows varying in the future from our predictions, and as we go further into the
future, these changes are potentially greater.
Choosing Projects When Resources Are Limited
Choosing positive NPV projects adds value to a company. Although we often assume that the company will
choose to pursue all positive NPV projects, in reality, managers often face a budget that restricts the amount
of capital that they may invest in a given time period. Thus, managers are forced to choose among several
positive NPV projects. The goal is to maximize the total NPV of the firm’s projects while remaining within
budget constraints.

Profitability Index
Managers should reject any project with a negative NPV. When managers find themselves with an array of
projects with a positive NPV, the profitability index can be used to choose among those projects. To learn

For example, suppose Southwest Manufacturing is considering the seven projects displayed inTable 16.14.
Each of the projects has a positive NPV and would add value to the company. The firm has a budget of $200
million to put toward new projects in the upcoming year. Doing all seven of the projects would require initial
investments totaling $430 million. Thus, although all of the projects are good projects, Southwest
Manufacturing cannot fund them all in the upcoming year and must choose among these projects. Southwest
Manufacturing could choose the combination of Projects A and D; the combination of Projects B, C, and E; or
several other combinations of projects and exhaust its $200 million investment budget.

To decide which combination results in the largest added NPV for the company, rank the projects based on
their profitability index, as is done inTable 16.15. Projects A, E, and F should be chosen, as they have the
highest profitability indexes. Because those three projects require a cumulative investment of $200 million,
none of the remaining projects can be undertaken at the present time. Doing those three projects will add $78
million in NPV to the firm. Out of this set of choices, there is no combination of projects that is affordable given
Southwest Manufacturing’s budget that would add more than $78 million in NPV.

Notice that when choices must be made among projects, the decision cannot be made by simply ranking the
projects from highest to lowest NPV. Project D has an NPV of $15 million, which is higher than both the $11
million of Project E and the $7 million of Project F. However, Project D requires $50 million for an initial

investment. For the same $50 million of investment funds, Southwest Manufacturer can accept both Projects E
and F for a total NPV of $18 million. Investment capital is a scare resource for this company. By ranking
projects based on their profitability index, the company is able to determine the best way to allocate its scarce
capital for the largest potential increase in NPV.
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Capital Budgeting Challenges
Although the basic techniques of project evaluation are straightforward, real-world capital budgeting
decisions are complex and multifaceted. The goal of capital budgeting is to choose the projects that will
bring the most value to the shareholders of the company. The NPV rule provides a clear, concise criterion
for which projects will bring value to the shareholders. It is important to remember, however, that all of the
project valuation calculations are based on projected cash flows. These projected cash flows are estimates,
based on the best educated guesses that a company makes about its business opportunities over the next
few years. Because no company has a crystal ball that can predict the future, its calculation of NPV is an
estimate of what it expects.
Think, for example, of an oil company deciding whether to drill for oil. The project will require expenditures
on equipment, land, and other items. The cash inflows will depend on the likelihood of oil being found, the
quantity of oil produced by the well, and the price at which the oil can be sold. If a company estimates that
oil will sell for $100 per barrel during the next few years, the project will have a much higher NPV than if the
company estimates that oil will sell for only $50 per barrel.
A project that has a positive NPV and is accepted when a company is planning how to allocate its capital
toward investments may end up being a bad project that the company wishes it had avoided if the future is
much different from what it projected. Managers must stay attuned to economic developments and
reevaluate capital budgeting decisions when significant changes occur. In spring 2020, managers around
the globe were faced with a dramatically changing economic environment amid a pandemic. Oil companies,
for example, saw oil prices drop from over $50 per barrel at the beginning of March to under $15 per barrel
by the end of April.

Reducing Capital Spending
In June 2020,McKinsey & Companylooked at major companies around the world that were reducing their
capital expenditures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. These companies were cutting their capital
budgets by 10% to 80% from their originally planned levels for 2020. Reductions were especially large in the
oil and gas industry, as companies found their revenue projections, and thus the NPV of their planned
projects, falling dramatically. In addition, companies found themselves needing to free up cash; with more
limited cash resources, fewer positive NPV projects could be accepted and funded.

16.6Using Excel to Make Company Investment Decisions
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate NPV using Excel.
•Calculate IRR using Excel.
•Create an NPV profile using Excel.
A MicrosoftExcelspreadsheet provides an alternative to using a financial calculator to automate the arithmetic
necessary to calculate NPV and IRR. An advantage of using Excel is that you can quickly change any
assumptions or numbers in your problem and recalculate NPV or IRR based on that updated information.
Excel is a versatile tool with more than one way to set up most problems. We will consider a couple of
straightforward examples of using Excel to calculate NPV and IRR.
Suppose your company is considering a project that will cost $30,000 this year. The cash inflow from this
project is expected to be $6,000 next year and $8,000 the following year. The cash inflow is expected to
increase by $2,000 yearly, resulting in a cash inflow of $18,000 in year 7, the final year of the project. You know
that your company’s cost of funds is 9%. Your company would like to evaluate this project.
Calculating NPV Using Excel
To calculate NPV using Excel, you would begin by placing each year’s expected cash flows in a sheet, as in row
5 inFigure 16.4. One approach to calculating NPV is to use the formula for discounting future cash flows, as is
shown in row 6.
Figure16.4Inserting Present Cash Flows Using Excel ($ except Cost of Funds)
Figure 16.5shows the present value of each year’s cash flow resulting from the formula. The NPV is then
calculated by summing the present values of the cash flows.
Download thespreadsheet file(https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet-file)containing key Chapter 16
Excel exhibits.
Figure16.5NPV Calculated by Summing Present Values of Cash Flows ($ except Cost of Funds)
Alternatively, Excel is programmed with financial functions, including a calculation for NPV. The NPV formula is
shown in cell J7 inFigure 16.6below. However, it is important to pay attention to how Excel defines NPV. The
Excel NPV function calculates the sum of the present values of the cash flows occurring from period 1 through
the end of the project using the designated discount rate, but it fails to include the initial investment at time
49616 • How Companies Think about Investing
Access for free at openstax.org

period zero at the beginning of the project. The NPV function in cell J6 will return $56,947 for this project. You
must subtract the initial cash outflow of $30,000 that occurs at time 0 to get the NPV of $26,947 for the project.
When entering the Excel-programmed NPV function, you must remember to include references only to the
cells that contain cash flows from year 1 to the end of the project. Then, subtract the initial investment of year
0 to calculate NPV according to the standard definition of NPV—the present values of the cash inflows minus
the present value of the cash outflow. Note: Because of the nonstandard use of the term NPV by Excel, many
users prefer to use the method described above rather than this predefined function.
Figure16.6NPV Formula ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)
Calculating IRR Using Excel
Excel also provide a function for calculating IRR. This function is shown inFigure 16.7, cell J8. The IRR function
properly uses all the project’s cash flows, including the initial cash outflow at time 0, in its calculation, unlike
the NPV function. This function will correctly return the IRR of 27.7% for the project.Figure 16.8shows the
completed spreadsheet.
Figure16.7Function for Calculating IRR ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)
Figure16.8Final Spreadsheet ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)
Using Excel to Create an NPV Profile
Firms often do not know exactly what their cost of attracting capital is, so they must use estimates in their
decision-making. Also, the cost of attracting capital can change with economic and market conditions.
Especially if markets are volatile, a company may use an NPV profile to see how sensitive their decisions are to
changes in financing costs. Excel simplifies the creation of an NPV profile.
Middleton Manufacturing is considering installing solar panels to heat water and provide lighting throughout
its plant. To do so will cost the company $800,000 this year. However, this upgrade will save the company an
estimated $150,000 in electrical costs each year for the next 10 years. Constructing an NPV profile of this
project will allow Middleton to see how the NPV of the project changes with the cost of attracting funds.
16.6 • Using Excel to Make Company Investment Decisions497

First, the project cash flows must be placed in an Excel spreadsheet, as is shown in cells D2 through N2 in
Figure 16.9. The company’s cost of funds is placed in cell B1; begin by putting in 10% for this rate. Next, the
formula for NPV is placed in cell B6; cell B6 shows the NPV of the cash flows in cells D2 through N2, using the
rate that is in cell B1.
For reference, compute IRR in cell B4. Calculating IRR is not necessary for creating the NPV profile. However, it
gives a good reference point. Remember that if the IRR of a project is greater than the firm’s cost of attracting
capital, then the NPV will be positive; if the IRR of a project is less than the firm’s cost of attracting capital, then
the NPV will be negative.
An NPV profile is created by calculating the NPV of the project for a variety of possible costs of attracting
capital. In other words, you want to calculate NPV using the project cash flows in cells D2 through N2, using a
variety of discount rates in cell B1. This is accomplished by using the Excel data table function. The data table
function shows how the outcome of an Excel formula changes when one of the cells in the spreadsheet
changes. In this instance, you want to determine how the value of the NPV formula (cell B6) changes when the
discount rate (cell B1) changes.
Figure16.9Project Cash Flows Inserted into Excel
To do this, enter the range of interest rates that you want to consider down a column, beginning in cell A7.
This example shows rates from 1% to 20% entered in cells A7 through A26. Your Excel file should now look like
the screenshot inFigure 16.9.
Next, highlight the cells containing the NPV calculation and the range of discount rates. Thus, you will highlight
cells A6 through A26 and B6 through B26 (seeFigure 16.10). Click Data at the top of the Excel menu so that you
see the What-If Analysis feature. Choose Data Table. Because the various discount rates you want to use are in
a column, use the “Column input cell” option. Enter “B1” in this box. You are telling Excel to calculate NPV
using each of the numbers in this column as the cost of attracting funds in cell B1. Click OK.

After clicking OK, the cells in column B next to the list of various discount rates will fill with the NPVs
corresponding to each of the rates. This is shown inFigure 16.11.
Figure16.11NPV Calculated for Various Discount Rates
Now that the various NPVs are calculated, you can create the NPV profile graph. To create the graph, begin by
highlighting the discount rates and NPVs that are in cells A7 through A26 and B7 through B26. Next, go to the
Insert tab in the menu at the top of Excel. Several different chart options will be available; choose Scatter. You
will end up with a chart that looks like the one inFigure 16.12. You can customize the chart by renaming it,
labeling the axes, and making other cosmetic changes if you like.
You will notice that the NPV profile crosses thex-axis between 13% and 14%; remember that the NPV will be
zero when the discount rate that is used to calculate the NPV is equal to the project’s IRR, which we previously
calculated to be 13.43%. If the firm’s cost of raising funds is lower than 13.43%, the NPV profile shows that the
project has a positive NPV, and the project should be accepted. Conversely, if the firm’s cost of raising funds is
greater than 13.43%, the NPV of this project will be negative, and the project should not be accepted.
16.6 • Using Excel to Make Company Investment Decisions499

Figure16.12NPV Profile Created Using Excel
Middleton Manufacturing can use this NPV profile to evaluate its solar panel installation project. If the
managers think that the cost of attracting funds for the company is 10%, then the project has a positive NPV of
$121,685 and the company should install the panels. The NPV profile shows that if the managers are
underestimating the cost of funds even by 30% and it will really cost Middleton 13% to attract funds, the
project is still a good project. The cost of attracting funds would have to be higher than 13.43% for the solar
panel project to be rejected.

Summary
16.1Payback Period Method
The payback period is the simplest project evaluation method. It is the time it takes the company to recoup its
initial investment. Its usefulness is limited, however, because it ignores the time value of money.
16.2Net Present Value (NPV) Method
Net present value (NPV) is calculated by subtracting the present value of a project’s cash outflows from the
present value of the project’s cash inflows. A project should be accepted if its NPV is positive and rejected if its
NPV is negative.
16.3Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method
The internal rate of return (IRR) of a project is the discount rate that sets the present value of a project’s cash
inflows exactly equal to the present value of the project’s cash outflows. A project should be accepted if its IRR
is greater than the firm’s cost of attracting capital.
16.4Alternative Methods
The discounted payback period uses the time value of money to discount future cash flows to see how long it
will be before the initial investment of a project is recovered. MIRR provides a variation on IRR in which all cash
flows are compounded using the cost of capital, resolving the reinvestment rate assumption problem of the
IRR method; unlike IRR, which may have multiple mathematical solutions, MIRR will result in one solution. The
profitability index is calculated as the NPV of the project divided by the initial cost of the project.
16.5Choosing between Projects
Firms may need to choose among a variety of good projects. The projects may have different lives or be
differently sized projects that require different amounts of resources. By choosing projects with the highest
profitability index, companies can take on the projects that will lead to the greatest increase in value for the
company.
16.6Using Excel to Make Company Investment Decisions
Excel spreadsheets provide a way to easily calculate the NPV and IRR of a project. Using Excel to create an NPV
profile allows a company to see how much its estimates of the cost of raising funds can err from the true cost
and have the project still be an acceptable project.

Why It Matters
The most important job that company managers have is to maximize the value of the company. Some obvious
things come to mind when you think of how managers would do this. For example, to maximize the value of
American Airlines, the managers need to attract customers and sell seats on flights. They also need to keep
costs as low as possible, which means keeping the costs of purchasing fuel and making plane repairs as low as
possible. While the concept of keeping costs low is simple, the specific decisions a firm makes can be complex.
If American Airlines wants to purchase a new airplane, it needs to consider not just the dollar cost of the initial
purchase but also the passenger and cargo capacity of the plane as well as ongoing maintenance costs.
In addition to paying salaries to its pilots and flight attendants, American Airlines must pay to use investors’
money. If the company wants to purchase a new airplane, it may borrow money to pay for the plane. Even if
American Airlines does not need to incur debt to buy the plane, the money it uses to buy the plane ultimately
belongs to the owners or shareholders of the company. The company must consider the opportunity cost of
this money and the return that shareholders are expecting on their investments.
Just as different planes have distinctive characteristics and costs, the different types of financing that American
Airlines can use will have different characteristics and costs. One of the tasks of the financial manager is to
consider the trade-offs of these sources of funding. In this chapter, we look at the basic principles that
managers use to minimize the cost of funding and maximize the value of the firm.

17.1The Concept of Capital Structure
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Distinguish between the two major sources of capital appearing on a balance sheet.
•Explain why there is a cost of capital.
•Calculate the weights in a company’s capital structure.
The Basic Balance Sheet
In order to produce and sell its products or services, a company needs assets. If a firm will produce shirts, for
example, it will need equipment such as sewing machines, cutting boards, irons, and a building in which to
store its equipment. The company will also need some raw materials such as fabric, buttons, and thread. These
items the company needs to conduct its operations areassets. They appear on the left-hand side of the
balance sheet.
The company has to pay for these assets. The sources of the money the company uses to pay for these assets
appear on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. The company’s sources of financing represent itscapital.
There are two broad types of capital: debt (or borrowing) and equity (or ownership).
Figure 17.2is a representation of a basic balance sheet. Remember that the two sides of the balance sheet
must be. Companies typically finance their assets through equity (selling
ownership shares to stockholders) and debt (borrowing money from lenders). The debt that a firm uses is
often referred to asfinancial leverage. The relative proportions of debt and equity that a firm uses in
financing its assets is referred to as itscapital structure.
Figure17.2Basic Balance Sheet for Company with Debt, Preferred Stock, and Common Equity in Capital Structure
Attracting Capital
When a company raises money from investors, those investors forgo the opportunity to invest that money
elsewhere. In economics terms, there is anopportunity costto those who buy a company’s bonds or stock.
Suppose, for example, that you have $5,000, and you purchaseTeslastock. You could have purchasedApple
stock or Disney stock instead. There were many other options, but once you chose Tesla stock, you no longer
had the money available for the other options. You would only purchase Tesla stock if you thought that you
would receive a return as large as you would have for the same level of risk on the other investments.
From Tesla’s perspective, this means that the company can only attract your capital if it offers an expected
return high enough for you to choose it as the company that will use your money. Providing a return equal to
what potential investors could expect to earn elsewhere for a similar risk is the cost a company bears in
exchange for obtaining funds from investors. Just as a firm must consider the costs of electricity, raw
materials, and wages when it calculates the costs of doing business, it must also consider the cost of attracting
capital so that it can purchase its assets.
Weights in the Capital Structure
Most companies have multiple sources of capital. The firm’s overall cost of capital is a weighted average of its
50817 • How Firms Raise Capital
Access for free at openstax.org

debt and equity costs of capital. The average of a firm’s debt and equity costs of capital, weighted by the
fractions of the firm’s value that correspond to debt and equity, is known as theweighted average cost of
capital (WACC).
The weights in the WACC are the proportions of debt and equity used in the firm’s capital structure. If, for
example, a company is financed 25% by debt and 75% by equity, the weights in the WACC would be 25% on the
debt cost of capital and 75% on the equity cost of capital. The balance sheet of the company would look like
Figure 17.3.
These weights can be derived from the right-hand side of a market-value-based balance sheet. Recall that
accounting-based book values listed on traditional financial statements reflect historical costs. The market-
value balance sheet is similar to the accounting balance sheet, but all values are current market values.
Figure17.3Balance Sheet of Company with Capital Structure of 25% Debt and 75% Equity
Just as the accounting balance sheet must balance, the market-value balance sheet must balance:
This equation reminds us that the values of a company’s debt and equity flow from the market value of the
company’s assets.
Let’s look at an example of how a company would calculate the weights in its capital structure.Bluebonnet
Industrieshas debt with a book (face) value of $5 million and equity with a book value of $3 million.
Bluebonnet’s debt is trading at 97% of its face value. It has one million shares of stock, which are trading for
$15 per share.
First, the market values of the company’s debt and equity must be determined. Bluebonnet’s debt is trading at
a discount; its market value is. The market value of Bluebonnet’s equity
equals. Thus, the total market
value of the company’s capital is. The weight of debt in
Bluebonnet’s capital structure is. The weight of equity in its capital structure is
.
17.2The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate the after-tax cost of debt capital.
•Explain why the return to debt holders is not the same as the cost to the firm.
•Calculate the cost of equity capital.
The costs of debt and equity capital are what company lenders (those who allow the firm to use their capital)
expect in return for providing that capital. Just as current market values of debt and equity should be used in
determining their weights in the capital structure, current market values of debt and equity should be used in
determining the costs of those types of financing.
17.2 • The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital509

Cost of Debt Capital
A company’s cost of debt is the interest rate it would have to pay to refinance its existing debt. Because a
firm’s existing debt trades in the marketplace, its price changes according to market conditions. The overall
credit environment can change due to changing macroeconomic conditions, causing a change in the price of
debt securities. In addition, as there are changes in the overall riskiness of the firm and its ability to repay its
creditors, the price of the debt securities issued by the firm will change.
The market price of a company’s existing bonds implies a yield to maturity. Recall that theyield to maturityis
the return that current purchasers of the debt will earn if they hold the bond to maturity and receive all of the
payments promised by the borrowing firm.
Yield to Maturity and the Cost of Debt
Bluebonnet’s debt is selling for 97% of its face value. This means that for every $100 of face value, investors
are currently paying $97 for an outstanding bond issued by Bluebonnet Industries. This debt has a coupon
rate of 6%, paid semiannually, and the bonds mature in 15 years.
Because the bonds are selling at a discount, the yield that investors who purchase these bonds will receive if
they hold the bond to maturity exceeds 6%. The purchasers of these bonds will receive a coupon payment of
every six months for the next 15 years. They will also receive the $100 face value when the
bonds mature in 15 years. To calculate the yield to maturity of these bonds using your financial calculator,
input the information shown inTable 17.1.

The yield to maturity (YTM) of Bluebonnet Industries bonds is 6.312%. This YTM should be used in estimating
the firm’s overall cost of capital, not the coupon rate of 6% that is stated on the outstanding bonds. The
coupon rate on the existing bonds is a historical rate, set under economic conditions that may have been
different from the current market conditions. The YTM of 6.312% represents what investors are currently
requiring to purchase the debt issued by the company.
After-Tax Cost of Debt
Although current debt holders demand to earn 6.312% to encourage them to lend to Bluebonnet Industries,
the cost to the firm is less than 6.312%. This is because interest paid on debt is a tax-deductible expense. When
a firm borrows money, the interest it pays is offset to some extent by the tax savings that occur because of this
deductible expense.
Theafter-tax cost of debtis the net cost of interest on a company’s debt after taxes. This after-tax cost of
debt is the firm’s effective cost of debt. The after-tax cost of debt is calculated as, whereis the
before-tax cost of debt, or the return that the lenders receive, andTis the company’s tax rate. If Bluebonnet

Industries has a tax rate of 21%, then the firm’s after-tax cost of debt is
This means that for every $1,000 Bluebonnet borrows, the company will have to pay its lenders
in interest every year. The company can deduct $63.12 from its income, so this
interest payment reduces the taxes the company must pay to the government by.

Cost of Equity Capital
Companies can raise money by selling stock, or ownership shares, of the company. Stock is known as equity
capital. The cost of common stock capital cannot be directly observed in the market; it must be estimated. Two
primary methods for estimating the cost of common stock capital are the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
and the constant dividend growth model.
CAPM
The CAPM is based on using the firm’s systematic risk to estimate the expected returns that shareholders
require to invest in the stock. According to the CAPM, the cost of equity (r
e
) can be estimated using the
formula
For example, suppose that Bluebonnet Industries has an equity beta of 1.3. Because the beta is greater than
17.2 • The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital511

one, the stock has more systematic risk than the average stock in the market. Assume that the rate on 10-year
US Treasury notes is 3% and serves as a proxy for the risk-free rate. If the long-run average return for the
stock market is 11%, the market risk premium isthis means that people who invest in the
stock market are rewarded for the risk they are taking by being paid 8% more than they would have been paid
if they had purchased US Treasury notes. Bluebonnet Industries cost of equity capital can be estimated as
Constant Dividend Growth Model
The constant dividend growth model provides an alternative method of calculating a company’s cost of equity.
The basic formula for the constant dividend growth model is
Thus, three things are needed to complete this calculation: the current stock price, what the dividend will be in
one year, and the growth rate of the dividend. The current price of the stock is easy to obtain by looking at the
financial news. The other two items, the dividend next year and the growth rate of the dividend, will occur in
the future and at the current time are not known with certainty; these two items must be estimated.
Suppose Bluebonnet paid a dividend of $1.50 per share to its shareholders last year. Also suppose that this
dividend has been growing at a rate of 2% each year for the past several years and that growth rate is
expected to continue into the future. Then, the dividend in one year can be expected to be
. If the current stock price is $12.50 per share, then that cost of equity is estimated
as
THINK IT THROUGH
Using the Constant Dividend Growth Model
What does an increase in the price of a company’s stock imply about the equity cost of capital for the
company? To find out what the constant dividend growth model suggests, assume that the stock price for
Bluebonnet Industries increases to $16.50 per share. If there is no expectation that the growth rate of the
dividends will increase, what would the new estimated equity cost of capital be?
Solution:
Using the price of $16.50 per share in the constant dividend growth model equation results in an estimated
equity cost of capital of
Thus, an increase in the price of the stock, holding all of the other variables in the equation constant,
implies that the equity cost of capital drops to 11.27%.
17.3Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
•Describe issues that arise from estimating the cost of equity capital.
•Describe the use of net debt in calculating WACC.
51217 • How Firms Raise Capital

Once you know the weights in a company’s capital structure and have estimated the costs of the different
sources of its capital, you can calculate the company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
WACC Equation
WACC is calculated using the equation
D%,P%, andE%represent the weight of debt, preferred stock, and common equity, respectively, in the capital
structure. Note thatmust equal 100% because the company must account for 100% of its
financing. The after-tax cost of debt is. The cost of preferred stock capital is represented byr

.
For a company that does not issue preferred stock,P%is equal to zero, and the WACC equation is simply
Earlier in this chapter, we calculated the weights in Bluebonnet Industries’ capital structure to be
and. We also calculated the after-tax cost of debt for Bluebonnet to be 4.99%. If we use the CAPM
to estimate the cost of equity capital for the firm, Bluebonnet’s WACC is computed as
If we use the constant dividend discount model to estimate the cost of equity for Bluebonnet Industries, the
WACC is computed as
Calculating WACC in Practice
The equation for calculating WACC is straightforward. However, issues come up when financial managers
calculate WACC in practice. Both the weights of the equity components and the cost of the equity components
are needed to calculate the WACC. The WACC that financial managers derive will depend on the assumptions
and models they use to determine what weights and capital costs to use.
Issues in Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital
We have explored two ways of estimating the cost of equity capital: the CAPM and the constant dividend
growth model. Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two
methods provide the same value.
In our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The
constant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC
calculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an
estimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.
For example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,
the market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US
Treasury security yields. In theory, the yield onUS Treasury securitiesthat have a maturity equivalent to the
length of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to
use yields on long-termUS Treasury bondsto determine the risk-free rate.
To estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data. Because this historical data is used to
estimate the future market risk premium, the question arises of how many years of historical data should be
used. Using more years of historical data can lead to more accurate estimates of what the average past return
has been, but very old data may have little relevance if today’s financial market environment is different from
what it was in the past. Old data may have little relevance for investors’ expectations today. Typical market risk
premiums used by financial managers range from 5% to 8%.
17.3 • Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital513

The same issue with how much historical data should be considered arises when calculating a company’s beta.
Different financial managers can calculate significantly different betas even for well-established, stable
companies. In April 2021, for example, the beta forIBMwas reported as 0.97 byMarketWatchand as 1.25 by
Yahoo! Finance.
The CAPM estimate of the cost of equity capital for IBM is significantly different depending on what source is
used for the company’s beta and what value is used for the market risk premium. Using a market risk
premium of 5%, the beta of 0.97 provided by MarketWatch, and a risk-free rate of 3% results in a cost of capital
of
If, instead, a market risk premium of 8% and the beta of 1.25 provided by Yahoo! Finance are used, the cost of
capital is estimated to be
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Estimating the Equity Cost of Capital
Although the calculation of the cost of capital using the CAPM equation is simple and straightforward, there
is not one definitive equity cost of capital for a company that all financial managers will agree on. Consider
the eight companies spotlighted inTable 17.3.
Four estimates of the equity cost of capital are calculated for each firm. The first two estimates are based
on the beta provided by MarketWatch for each of the companies. A risk-free rate of 3% is assumed. Market
risk premiums of both 5% and of 8% are considered. A market risk premium of 5% would suggest that long-
run investors who hold a well-diversified portfolio, such as one with all of the stocks in the S&P 500, will
average a return 5 percentage points higher than the risk-free rate, or 8%. If you assume instead that the
average long-run return on the S&P 500 is 11%, then people who purchase a portfolio of those stocks are
rewarded by earning 8 percentage points more than the 3% they would earn investing in the risk-free
security.
The last two estimates of the cost of equity capital for each company also use the same risk-free rate of 3%
and the possible market risk premiums of 5% and 8%. The only difference is that the beta provided by
Yahoo! Finance is used in the calculation.

The range of the equity cost of capital estimates for each of the firms is significant. Consider, for example,
Goodyear Tire and Rubber. According to MarketWatch, the beta for the company is 1.24, resulting in an
estimated cost of equity capital between 9.20% and 12.92%. The beta provided by Yahoo! Finance is much
higher, at 2.26. Using this higher beta results in an estimated equity cost of capital for Goodyear Tire and
Rubber between 14.30% and 21.08%. This leaves the financial managers of Goodyear Tire and Rubber with
an estimate of the equity cost of capital between 9.20% and 21.08%, using a range of reasonable
assumptions.
What is a financial manager to do when one estimate is more than twice as large as another estimate? A
financial manager who believes the equity cost of capital is close to 9% is likely to make very different
choices from one who believes the cost is closer to 21%. This is why it is important for a financial manager
to have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know
the historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to
know that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are
so different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic
environment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going
forward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what
the numbers will be going forward.
It is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do
see a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has
a beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of
equity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta
less than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta
greater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.
Recall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of
food products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but
during expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,
companies such asKroger,Coca-Cola, andKraft Heinzwill tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost
of capital below 8% to 11%.
The sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,
people fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back
on these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such asAmerican AirlinesandKB Homeswill have
higher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost
of capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than
in lower-risk companies.
The CAPM estimate depends on assumptions made, but issues also exist with the constant dividend growth
model. First, the constant dividend growth model can be used only for companies that pay dividends. Second,
the model assumes that the dividends will grow at a constant rate in the future, an assumption that is not
always reasonable. It also assumes that the financial manager accurately forecasts the growth rate of
dividends; any error in this forecast results in an error in estimating the cost of equity capital.
Given the differences in assumptions made when using the constant dividend growth model and the CAPM to
estimate the equity cost of capital, it is not surprising that the numbers from the two models differ. When
estimating the cost of equity capital for a particular firm, financial managers must examine the assumptions
made for both approaches and decide which set of assumptions is more realistic for that particular company.
17.3 • Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital515

Net Debt
Many practitioners usenet debtrather than total debt when calculating the weights for WACC. Net debt is the
amount of debt that would remain if a company used all of its liquid assets to pay off as much debt as
possible. Net debt is calculated as the firm’s total debt, both short-term and long-term, minus the firm’s cash
and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are current assets that can quickly and easily be converted into cash,
such as Treasury bills, commercial paper, and marketable securities.
Consider, for example, Apple, which had $112.436 billion in total debt in 2020. The company also had $38.016
billion in cash and cash equivalents. This meant that the net debt for Apple was only $74.420 billion. If Apple
used all of its cash and cash equivalents to pay debt, it would be left with $74.420 billion in debt.

Cash and cash equivalents can be viewed as negative debt. For firms with relatively low levels of cash, this
adjustment will not have a large impact on the overall WACC estimate. However, the adjustment can be
important for firms that hold substantial cash reserves.
17.4Capital Structure Choices
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Distinguish between a levered and an unlevered firm.
•Explain why the choice of capital structure does not impact the value of a firm in perfect financial markets.
•Calculate the interest tax shield.
•Explain how the interest tax shield encourages the use of leverage.
So far, we have taken the company’s capital structure as given. Each firm’s capital structure, however, is a
result of intentional decisions made by the financial managers of the company. We now turn our attention to
the issues that financial managers consider when making these decisions.
The Unlevered Firm
Let’s begin our discussion of capital structure choices by exploring the financing decisions you would face if
you were to start a T-shirt business. Suppose that your hometown will host an international cycling
competition. The competition itself will last for a month; cyclists will arrive early to train in the local climate.
News coverage will be significant, meaning a lot of media personnel will be visiting your area. In addition to
fans attending the event, it is expected that tourism will increase over the next year as recreational cyclists will
want to ride the route of the professional race. You decide to operate a business for one year that will sell T-
shirts highlighting this event.
You will need to make an up-front investment of $40,000 to start the business. You estimate that you will
generate a cash flow of $52,000, after you cover all of your operating costs, at the end of next year. You know
that these profits are risky; you think a 10% risk premium is appropriate for the level of riskiness of the
business. If the risk-free rate is 4%, this means that the appropriate discount rate for you to use is 14%. The
value of this business opportunity is
This looks as if it will be a profitable business that should be undertaken. However, you do not have the
$40,000 for the up-front investment and will need to raise it.
First, consider raising money solely by selling ownership shares to your family and friends. How much would
those shares be worth? The value of the stock would be equal to the present value of the expected future cash
flows. The potential stockholders would expect to receive $45,614 in one year. If they agree with you that the
riskiness of this T-shirt business warrants a discount rate of 14%, then they will value the stock at

If you sell all of the equity in the company for $45,614 and purchase the equipment necessary for the project
for $40,000, you have $5,614 to keep as the entrepreneur who created the business.
This business would be financed 100% by equity. The lack of any debt in the capital structure means the firm
would have no financial leverage. The equity in a firm that has no financial leverage is calledunlevered
equity.
The Levered Firm
Next, consider borrowing some of the money that you will need to start this T-shirt business. Although the
cash flows from the business are uncertain, suppose you are certain that the business will generate at least
$18,000. (Perhaps you have a guaranteed order from the cycling competition sponsors.) If you borrowed
$17,000 at the risk-free interest rate of 4%, you would oweto the lenders at the
end of the year. Because you are certain that you will generate at least $18,000 in cash, which is greater than
$17,680, you can borrow the $17,000 without any risk of defaulting.
The $17,000 will not be enough to pay for all the start-up costs. You will also need to raise some capital by
selling equity. Because your firm will have some debt, or financial leverage, the equity that you raise will be
known aslevered equity. The equity holders expect the firm to generate $52,000 in cash flows. Debt holders
must be paid before equity holders, so this will leavefor the shareholders.
The expected future cash flows generated by the business are determined by the productivity of its assets, not
the manner in which those assets are financed. It is the present value of these expected future cash flows that
determines the firm’s value. Thus, the firm’s value in perfect capital markets will not change as a result of the
company taking on leverage.

MM Proposition I
Nobel laureates FrancoModiglianiand MertonMillerwrote influential papers exploring capital structure
and the cost of a firm’s capital. They began by considering what would occur in a perfectly competitive
market. One of the assumptions of this perfect capital market is that there are no taxes. The idea that the
market value of the unlevered and levered firm is the same in perfect capital markets is known in the field
of finance asMM Proposition I.

Now, shareholders are willing to pay $28,614 for ownership in this company. They expect to get $34,320 in one
year in return for purchasing this equity. What discount rate does this imply?
17.4 • Capital Structure Choices517

Notice that the expected return to shareholders has risen from 14% for the unlevered firm to 19.94% for the
levered firm. Recall that the expected return to shareholders equals the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The
risk-free rate has remained 4%. With leverage, the risk premium rises from 10% to 15.94%.
Why does this risk premium increase? Recall that debt holders are paid before equity holders. Equity holders
are residual claimants; they will only receive payment if there is money left over after the debt holders are fully
paid. The business is risky. You are certain that the company will have cash flow of at least $18,000 at the end
of the year and that $17,680 will be paid to the debt holders. Therefore, if the company performs poorly
(perhaps bad weather results in the cancellation of much of the cycling competition) and the cash flows fall
way below what you are expecting, there may be only several hundred dollars left for the shareholders.
When the firm was unlevered, if the cash flow at the end of the year was only $18,000, the shareholders would
receive $18,000. When leverage is used, the same cash flow would result in shareholders receiving only $320.
The risk to the shareholders increases as leverage is used; thus, the risk premium that shareholders require
also increases as leverage is used.
Leverage and the WACC
What happens to the WACC as leverage is used? To figure this out, we must calculate the weights of debt and
equity in the capital structure:
In perfect capital markets, an assumption we are making for now, there are no taxes. Because we are using
only debt and common stock, the weight of preferred stock is zero, and our WACC can be calculated as
Notice that the use of leverage does not change the WACC. When only equity was used to finance the
business, stockholders required a 14% expected return to encourage them to let the firm use their capital.
When leverage was used, the debt holders only required a 4% return. However, the existence of debt holders,
who stand in front of shareholders in the order of claimants, puts shareholders in a riskier position. There is a
greater chance that the shareholders will not receive payment from this uncertain business. Thus, the
shareholders require a higher rate of return to let the leveraged firm use their capital.
The cost-savings benefits of using lower-cost debt in your company’s capital structure are exactly offset by the
higher return that shareholders require when leverage is used. Mathematically, the increase in the cost of
equity when leverage is used will be proportional to the debt–equity ratio. Financial managers refer to this
outcome as MM Proposition II. The relationship is expressed by the formula
wherer
u
is the required return to equity holders of the unlevered firm.
Table 17.4shows how the cost of equity increases as the weight of debt in the capital structure increases. As
the company uses more debt, the risk to equity holders increases. Because equity holders risk that there will
be no residual money after bondholders are paid, the equity holders require a higher rate of return to invest in
the company as its use of leverage increases. Although debt holders face less risk than equity holders, the risk
that they face increases as the amount of debt the company takes on increases. Once the company’s debt
exceeds its guaranteed cash flow, which is $18,000 in our example, debt holders face some risk that the
company will not be able to pay them. At that point, the cost of debt rises above the risk-free rate. As the
51817 • How Firms Raise Capital

weight of debt approaches 100%, the cost of debt capital approaches the cost of equity of the unlevered firm.
In other words, if you financed the T-shirt business solely through the use of debt, the debt holders would
require a 14% return because they would be bearing the entire risk of the business and would demand to be
rewarded for doing so.
As the leverage of the firm increases, both the cost of debt capital and the cost of equity capital increase.
However, as the firm’s leverage increases, it is using proportionately more of the relatively cheaper source of
capital—debt— and proportionately less of the relatively more expensive source of capital—equity. Thus, the
WACC remains constant as leverage increases, despite the rising cost of each component.

The Impact of Taxes
In perfect capital markets, the choice of capital structure will not impact the value of the firm or the cost of the
firm’s financing. In the real world, however, capital markets are not perfect. One of the important market
imperfections is the presence of corporate taxes. Because the choice of capital structure can impact the taxes
that a company pays, in the real world, capital structure can impact the cost of capital and the firm’s value.
Assume that your T-shirt business venture will result in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $52,000
next year and that the corporate tax rate is 28%. If your company is unlevered, it has no interest expense, and
its net income will be $37,440, as shown inTable 17.5.
Without LeverageWith Leverage

Taxes (28%)14,560.0014,481.60
Net Income$37,440.00$37,238.40
Table17.5Net Income and Leverage
If your company uses leverage, raising $7,000 of financing by issuing debt with a 4% interest rate, it will have
an interest expense of $280. This lowers its taxable income to $51,720 and its taxes to $14,481.60. Because
interest is a tax-deductible expense, using leverage lowers the company’s taxes.
Table 17.6shows that the company’s net income is lower with leverage than it would be without leverage. In
other words, debt obligations will reduce the value of the equity. However, less equity is needed because some
of the firm is financed through debt. The important consideration is how the use of leverage changes the total

amount of dollars available to all investors.Table 17.6shows this impact.

Total Available for All Investors$37,440.00$37,518.40
Table17.6Total Dollars Available to Investors
Using leverage allows the firm to generate $37,518.40 to pay its investors, compared to only $37,440 that is
available if the firm is unlevered. Where does the extra $78.40 to pay investors come from? It comes from the
reduction in taxes that the firm pays due to leverage. If the company uses no debt, it pays $14,560 in taxes. The
levered firm pays only $14,481.60 in taxes, a savings of $78.40.
The $280 that the levered company pays in interest is shielded from the corporate tax, resulting in tax savings
of. The additional amount available to investors because of the tax deductibility of
interest payments is known as theinterest tax shield. The interest tax shield is calculated as
When interest is a tax-deductible expense, the total value of the levered firm will exceed the value of the
unlevered firm by the amount of this interest tax shield. The tax-advantage status of debt financing impacts
the WACC. The WACC with taxes is calculated as
This formula can be written as
Thus, the WACC with taxes is lower than the pretax WACC because of the interest tax shield. The more debt the
firm has, the greater the dollar amount of this interest tax shield. The presence of the interest tax shield
encourages firms to use debt financing in their capital structures.
17.5Optimal Capital Structure
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain how increased use of leverage increases the possibility of financial distress.
•Explain how the possibility of financial distress impacts the cost of capital.
•Discuss the trade-offs a firm faces as it increases its leverage.
•Explain the concept of an optimal capital structure.
Debt and Financial Distress
The more debt a company uses in its capital structure, the larger the dollar value of the interest tax shield.
Why, then, do we not see firms using a capital structure composed 100% of debt to maximize this interest tax
shield?
The answer to this question lies in the fact that as a company increases its debt, there is a greater chance that
the firm will be unable to make its required interest payments on the debt. If the firm has difficulty meeting its
52017 • How Firms Raise Capital
Access for free at openstax.org

debt obligations, it is said to be infinancial distress.
A firm in financial distress incurs both direct and indirect costs. The direct costs of financial distress include
fees paid to lawyers, consultants, appraisers, and auctioneers. The indirect costs include loss of customers and
suppliers.
Trade-Off Theory
Trade-off theoryweighs the advantages and disadvantages of using debt in the capital structure. The
advantage of using debt is the interest tax shield. The disadvantage of using debt is that it increases the risk of
financial distress and the costs associated with financial distress.
A company has an incentive to increase leverage to exploit the interest tax shield. However, too much debt will
make it more likely that the company will default and incur financial distress costs. Calculating the precise
balance between these two is difficult if not impossible.
For companies with a low level of debt, the risk of default is low, and the main impact of an increase in
leverage will be an increase in the interest tax shield. At some point, however, the tax savings that result from
increasing the amount of debt in the capital structure will be just offset by the increased probability of
incurring the costs of financial distress. For firms that have higher costs of financing distress, this point will be
reached sooner. Thus, firms that face higher costs of financial distress have a lower optimal level of leverage
than firms that face lower costs of financial distress.

Netflix
Netflixhas experienced phenomenal growth in the past 25 years. Starting as a DVD rental company, Netflix
quickly shifted its model to content streaming. In recent years, the company has become a major producer
of content, and it is currently the largest media/entertainment company by market capitalization. It is
expensive for Netflix to fund the production of this content. Netflix has funded much of its content through
selling debt.
You can view the company’s explanation of this capital structure choice by looking at the answersthe
company provides to common investor questions(https://openstax.org/r/the-company-provides). You can
also find the company’s financial statements on its website and see how the level of debt on Netflix’s
balance sheet has increased over the past few years.

u
is the
value of the unlevered firm, or the firm with no debt. As the firm begins to add debt to its capital structure, the
value of the firm increases due to the interest tax shield. The more debt the company takes on, the greater the
tax benefit it receives, up until the point at which the company’s interest expense exceeds its earnings before
interest and taxes (EBIT). Once the interest expense equals EBIT, the firm will have no taxable income. There is
no tax benefit from paying more interest after that point.
17.5 • Optimal Capital Structure521

Figure17.4Maximum Value of a Levered Firm
As the firm increases debt and increases the value of the tax benefit of debt, it also increases the probability of
facing financial distress. The magnitude of the costs of financial distress increases as the debt level of the
company rises. To some degree, these costs offset the benefit of the interest tax shield.
The optimal debt level occurs at the point at which the value of the firm is maximized. A company will use this
optimal debt level to determine what the weight of debt should be in its target capital structure. The optimal
capital structure is the target. Recall that the market values of a company’s debt and equity are used to
determine the costs of capital and the weights in the capital structure. Because market values change daily
due to economic conditions, slight variations will occur in the calculations from one day to the next. It is
neither practical nor desirable for a firm to recalculate its optimal capital structure each day.
Also, a company will not want to make adjustments for minor differences between its actual capital structure
and its optimal capital structure. For example, if a company has determined that its optimal capital structure is
22.5% debt and 77.5% equity but finds that its current capital structure is 23.1% debt and 76.9% equity, it is
close to its target. Reducing debt and increasing equity would require transaction costs that might be quite
significant.
Table 17.7shows the average WACC for some common industries. The calculations are based on corporate
information at the end of December 2020. A risk-free rate of 3% and a market-risk premium of 5% are assumed
in the calculations. You can see that the capital structure used by firms varies widely by industry. Companies in
the online retail industry are financed almost entirely through equity capital; on average, less than 7% of the
capital comes from debt for those companies. On the other hand, companies in the rubber and tires industry
tend to use a heavy amount of debt in their capital structure. With a debt weight of 63.62%, almost two-thirds
of the capital for these companies comes from debt.

Industries that have high betas, such as hotels/gaming and air transport, have high equity costs of capital.
More recession-proof industries, such as food processing and household products, have low betas and low
equity costs of capital. The WACC for each industry ends up being influenced by the weights of equity and debt
the company chooses, the riskiness of the industry, and the tax rates faced by companies in the industry.
17.6Alternative Sources of Funds
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Calculate the required return to preferred shareholders.
•Calculate the WACC of a firm that issues preferred shares.
•Discuss how issuing new equity impacts the cost of equity capital.
•Explain the functionality of convertible debt.
A company can finance its assets in two ways: through debt financing and through equity financing. Thus far,
we have treated these sources as two broad categories, each with a single cost of capital. In reality, a company
may have different types of debt or equity, each with its own cost of capital. The same principle would apply:
the WACC of the firm would be calculated using the weights of each of these types multiplied by the cost of
that particular type of debt or equity capital.
Preferred Shares
Although our calculations of WACC thus far have assumed that companies finance their assets only through
debt and common equity, we saw at the beginning of the chapter that the basic WACC formula is
In addition to common stock, a company can raise equity capital by issuingpreferred stock. Owners of
17.6 • Alternative Sources of Funds523

preferred stock are promised a fixed dividend, which must be paid before any dividends can be paid to
common stockholders.
In the order of claimants, preferred shareholders stand in line between bondholders and common
shareholders. Bondholders are paid interest before preferred shareholders are paid annual dividends.
Preferred shareholders are paid annual dividends before common shareholders are paid dividends. Should
the company face bankruptcy, the same priority of claimants is followed in settling claims—first bondholders,
then preferred stockholders, with common stockholders standing at the end of the line.
Preferred stock shares some characteristics with debt financing. It has a promised cash flow to its holders.
Unlike common equity, the dividend on preferred stock is fixed and known. Also, there are consequences if
those preferred dividends are not paid. Common shareholders cannot receive any dividends until preferred
dividends are paid, and in some cases, preferred shareholders receive voting rights until they are paid the
dividends that are due. However, preferred shareholders cannot force the company into bankruptcy as debt
holders can. For tax and legal purposes, preferred stock is treated as equity.
The cost of the preferred equity capital is calculated using the formula
Suppose that Greene Building Company has issued preferred stock that pays a dividend of $2.00 each year. If
this preferred stock is selling for $21.80 per share, then the company’s cost of preferred stock is
THINK IT THROUGH
Calculating Common Equity Financing
Greene Building Company uses 40% debt, 15% preferred stock, and 45% common stock in its capital
structure. The yield to maturity on the company’s bonds is 7.2%. The cost of preferred equity is 9.17%. In
the most recent year, Greene paid a dividend of $3.15 to its common shareholders. This dividend has been
growing at a rate of 3.0% per year, which is expected to continue in the future. The company’s common
stock is trading for $32.25 per share. Greene pays a corporate tax rate of 21%. Estimate the WACC for
Greene.
Solution:
The cost of Greene’s common equity financing must be calculated. This can be done using the constant
dividend growth model:
The weights and the costs for each component of capital are placed in the WACC formula:
The WACC for Greene Building Company is estimated to be 9.47%. Note that debt financing is the cheapest
cost of capital for Greene. The reason for this is twofold. First, because debt holders face the least amount
of risk because they are paid first in the order of claimants, they require a lower return. Second, because
interest payments are tax-deductible, the interest tax shield lowers the effective cost of debt to the
52417 • How Firms Raise Capital

company. Preferred shareholders will require a higher rate of return than debt holders, 9.17%, because
they are later in the order of claimants. Common shareholders are the residual claimants, standing at the
end of the line to receive payment. After all other claimants are paid, any remaining money belongs to the
shareholders. If this residual amount is small, the common shareholders receive a small payment. If there is
nothing left after all other claimants have been paid, common shareholders receive nothing. Thus, common
shareholders have the greatest amount of risk and require the highest rate of return.
Also, note that the weights for debt, preferred stock, and common stock in the capital structure sum to
100%. The company must finance 100% of its assets.
Issuing New Common Stock
An existing firm can acquire equity capital to expand its assets in two ways: the retention of earnings or the
sale of new shares of stock. Thus far in the chapter, the cost of equity capital calculations have assumed that
the earnings were being retained for equity capital financing.
The net income that is left after all expenses are paid is the residual income that belongs to the shareholders.
Instead of receiving a fixed payment for letting the firm use their capital (like bondholders who receive fixed
interest payments), the reward to shareholders for letting the company use their capital varies from year to
year. In a good year, net income and the reward to shareholders is high. In a poor year, net income is low or
perhaps even negative.
The net income can either be paid immediately and directly to shareholders in the form of dividends or be
retained within the company to fund growth. Shareholders are willing to allow the company to retain these
earnings because they expect that the money will be used to fund profitable projects, leading to an even larger
reward for shareholders in future years.
Although managers do not need to actively solicit the funds that are retained to fund the business, managers
cannot view these funds as costless. The shareholders will require a return on those funds to entice them to
allow the company to delay paying the dollars to them immediately in terms of a dividend.
Suppose a company has $1 million in net income one year. If it pays $250,000 in dividends and retains
$750,000, then it can finance $750,000 more in assets. If the company has a capital structure of 25% debt and
75% equity and wants to maintain that capital structure, it must increase its debt by $250,000 to balance the
increase in equity. Thus, the company would be increasing its total financing by $1 million. Of that financing,
25% would be debt financing, and 75% would be equity financing.
To increase its assets by more than $1 million, the company would need to decide to either change its capital
structure or issue new stock. Consider the firm represented by the market-value balance sheet inFigure 17.5.
The firm has $900 million in assets. These assets are financed by $225 million in debt capital and $675 million
in equity capital, resulting in a capital structure of 25% debt and 75% equity.
Figure17.5Market-Value Balance Sheet for a Company with $900 Million in Assets and a Capital Structure of 25% Debt and
75% Equity
The retained earnings of $750,000 cause the equity on the balance sheet to increase to $675.75 million. The
17.6 • Alternative Sources of Funds525

company could sell $250,000 in bonds, increasing its debt to $225.25 million.Figure 17.6shows the impact on
the balance sheet. The company has increased its financing by $1,000,000 and can expand assets by
$1,000,000. The capital structure remains 25% debt and 75% equity.
Figure17.6Balance Sheet with $1 Million Growth Financed through Retained Earnings and New Debt
What if the economy is in an expansionary period and this company thinks it has the opportunity to grow at a
rate of 5%? The company knows that it will need more assets to be able to grow. If it needs 5% more assets, its
assets will need to increase to $945 million. To increase the left-hand side of its balance sheet, the company
will also need to increase the right-hand side of the balance sheet.
Where does the company get the $45 million in capital? With $750,000 in retained earnings, the company can
increase its equity to $675.75 million, but if the remainder of $44.25 million was financed through debt, the
company’s capital structure would change. Its weight of debt would increase to
If the company has determined that its optimal capital structure is 25% debt and 75% equity, financing the
majority of the growth through debt would cause it to stray from these levels. Funding the growth while
keeping the capital structure the same would require the firm to issue new shares.Figure 17.7shows how the
firm would need to finance $45 million in growth while maintaining its desirable capital structure. The firm
would need to increase equity capital to $708.75 million; retained earnings could provide $750,000, but $33
million of new equity would need to be sold.
Figure17.7Balance Sheet with $45,000,000 in Financing Coming from Debt, Retained Earnings, and New Stock
Investors who are providing common equity financing require a return to entice them to let the company use
their money. If this company has paid $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders and this dividend is
expected to increase by 3% each year, we can use the constant dividend growth model to estimate how much
common shareholders require. If the stock is trading for $8.00 per share, the cost of common equity financing
is estimated as
If, however, the firm must issue more equity, its cost of equity for those additional shares will be higher than
9.44%. Even if shareholders are willing to pay $8.00 per share for the stock, the firm will incurflotation costs;
this means the firm will not receive the entire $8.00 to use to finance new assets and generate a profit for
shareholders. Flotation costs include the costs of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as

well as the fees paid to investment bankers to place the new shares.
When new equity must be issued to finance the company, the flotation costs must be subtracted from the
price of the stock to determine the net proceeds the firm will receive. The cost of this new equity capital is
calculated as
whereFrepresents the flotation costs of the new stock issue. If, in this example, the flotation cost is $0.25 per
share, then the cost of raising new equity capital is
Issuing new common equity is the most expensive form of raising capital. Equity capital is already expensive
because the common shareholders are the residual claimants who will only be paid if all other claimants are
paid. Because of this risk, they require a higher rate of return than providers of capital who have precedence in
the order of claimants. Flotation costs must be added to this equity cost when new shares are issued to grow
the company.
THINK IT THROUGH
Cost of Issuing New Equity
You are a financial manager for American Motor Works (AMW). The target capital structure for the company
is 30% debt and 70% equity. You know that your company’s after-tax cost of debt is 4.6%. Your company
paid a dividend of $3 per share last year, and it has a policy of increasing its dividend at a rate of 1.5% each
year. AMW stock is currently trading for $27.50 per share. You estimate that the company’s retained
earnings will be $10 million this year. If the company needs to issue new shares of stock, flotation costs are
expected to be $0.75 per share.
Given this information, you are tasked with calculating the company’s WACC. You need to provide an
estimate of WACC if retained earnings are used and an estimate if new equity must be issued.
Solution:
First, calculate the cost of equity capital for AMW using the constant dividend growth model:
Using 12.57% as the equity cost of capital and 4.6% as the after-tax cost of debt, the WACC is calculated as
The WACC for AMW when it is using retained earnings for equity financing is 10.18%. If the company has
$10 million in retained earnings this year, its equity will increase by $10 million. Given its target capital
structure of 30% debt and 70% equity, AMW will be able to increase its overall financing by
by using its retained earnings and issuing new debt of $4,285,714.
If AMW wants to expand its assets by more than $14,285,714 during the next year, it will need to issue new
stock or increase the weight of debt in its capital structure. The company will incur flotation costs of $0.65
per share to issue new stock. The cost of new equity capital will be
17.6 • Alternative Sources of Funds527

With this more expensive newly issued equity capital, AMW’s WACC will become
If AMW wants to take on a large project that requires investment in more than $14,285,714 worth of assets,
such as building a new production facility, the company will need to issue more equity and will face a higher
WACC than when using retained earnings as its equity financing.
Convertible Debt
Some companies issueconvertible bonds. These corporate bonds have a provision that gives the bondholder
the option of converting each bond held into a fixed number of shares of common stock. The number of
common shares the bondholder would receive for each bond is known as theconversion ratio.
Suppose that you own a convertible bond issued by Sheridan Sodas with a face value of $1,000 and a
conversion ratio of 20 shares that matures today. If you convert the bond today, you will receive 20 shares of
Sheridan common stock. If you do not convert, you will receive $1,000. If you convert, you are basically paying
$1,000 for 20 shares of Sheridan stock. Theconversion priceisIf Sheridan is trading for more
than $50 per share, you would want to convert. If Sheridan is trading for less than $50 per share, you would
not want to convert; you would prefer the $1,000. In other words, you will choose to convert whenever the
stock price exceeds the conversion price at maturity.
A convertible bond gives the holder an option; the bondholder is able to choose between the face value cash
or receiving shares of stock. Options always have a positive value to holders. It is always preferable to be able
to choose $1,000 or shares of stock than to simply be given $1,000. There is a possibility that the shares of
stock will be more valuable, and there is no way the choice can put you in a worse position.
Because holders of convertible bonds have the valuable option of conversion that holders of nonconvertible
bonds do not have, convertible debt can be offered with a lower interest rate. It might seem as if the firm
could lower its weighted average cost of capital by issuing convertible debt rather than nonconvertible debt.
However, this is not the case. Remember that holders of convertible bonds choose whether they would prefer
to convert the bond and become a stockholder or receive the face value of the bond at maturity.
If a bond has a face value of $1,000, the convertible bond holders will consider whether the stock they can
convert to is worth more than $1,000. Only when the price of the stock has increased enough that the value of
the stock received is more than $1,000 will the bondholders convert. However, this means that instead of
paying $1,000, the firm is paying the bondholder in stock worth more than $1,000. In essence, the firm (and
the current shareholders) would be selling an equity position in the company for less than the market price of
that equity position. The lower interest rate compensates for the possibility that conversion will occur.

Summary
17.1The Concept of Capital Structure
Capital structure refers to how a company finances its assets. The two main sources of capital are debt
financing and equity financing. A cost of capital exists because investors want a return equivalent to what they
would receive on an investment with an equivalent risk to persuade them to let the company use their funds.
The market values of debt and equity are used to calculate the weights of the components of the capital
structure.
17.2The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital
The yield to maturity (YTM) on a company’s outstanding bonds represents the return that debt holders are
requiring to lend money to the company. Because interest expenses are tax-deductible, the cost of debt to the
company is less than the YTM. The cost of equity capital is not directly observed, so financial managers must
estimate this cost. Two common methods for estimating the cost of equity capital are the constant dividend
growth model and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).
17.3Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital
Calculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using the formula
Remember that the WACC is an estimate; different methods of estimating the cost of equity capital can lead to
different estimations of WACC.
17.4Capital Structure Choices
An unlevered firm uses no debt in its capital structure. A levered firm uses both debt and equity in its capital
structure. In perfect financial markets, the value of the firm will be the same regardless of the firm’s decision
to use leverage. With the tax deductibility of interest expenses, however, the value of the firm can increase
through the use of debt. As the level of debt increases, the value of the interest tax shield increases.
17.5Optimal Capital Structure
A company wants to choose a capital structure that maximizes its value. Although increasing the level of
financial leverage, or debt, in the capital structure increases the value of the interest tax shield, it also
increases the probability of financial distress. As the weight of debt in the capital structure increases, the
return that providers of both debt and equity capital require to entice them to provide money to the firm
increases because their risk increases. Trade-off theory suggests that the value of a company that uses debt
equals the value of the unlevered firm plus the value of the interest tax shield minus financial distress costs.
17.6Alternative Sources of Funds
Preferred stock is a type of equity capital; the owners of preferred stock receive preferential treatment over
common stockholders in the order of claimants. A fixed dividend is paid to preferred shareholders and must
be paid before common shareholders receive dividends. Equity capital can be raised through either retaining
earnings or selling new shares of stock. Significant flotation costs are associated with issuing new shares of
stock, making it the most expensive source of financing. Convertible debt allows the debt holders to convert
their debt into a fixed number of common shares instead of receiving the face value of the stock at maturity.

Why It Matters
Though no one in business has a crystal ball, managers must often do all they can to predict the future as
accurately as possible. This is calledforecasting. Accounting and finance professionals use past performance
along with what they know about the business, its competitors, the economy, and the company’s plans for the
future to assemble detailed financial forecasts. Forecasts are useful to many individuals for different reasons.
A budget, a type of staticforecast, helps accountants and managers see how their plans for the coming year
can be achieved. It outlines sales targets and how much can be spent on cost of goods sold and expenses to
achieve the company’s bottom-line (net income) targets. Investors use financial forecasts to help guide their
decisions to buy, sell or hold stocks or to estimate future potential income through dividends. Perhaps most
importantly, for our purposes in finance, forecasts are used to help predict and manage cash flows.
A business can have all the profit in the world at the end of the year, but if it doesn’t raise enough cash
(liquidity) to pay the bills and pay its employees halfway through the year, it could still go bankrupt despite
being profitable. Forecasting sales and expenses helps assemble a cash forecast—when sales will be collected
and when expenses will be paid—so that financial managers can look forward far enough to have enough time
to react accordingly and secure short- or long-term financing to meet gaps in cash flow.

18.1The Importance of Forecasting
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Discuss how to use financial statements in forecasting firm financials.
•Explain why balance sheet items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.
•Explain why income statement items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.
In this section, we will briefly review some of the basic elements of financial statements and how we can
analyze historical statements to help assemble financial forecasts. Financial forecasting is important to short-
and long-term firm success. It helps a firm plan for the resources it will need, ensuring it will have enough cash
on hand at the right time to cover daily operations and capital expenditures. It helps the firm communicate its
future potential and manage its shareholders’ expectations. It also helps management assess future risk and
set plans in place to mitigate that risk.
Financial forecasting involves using historical data, analysis tools, and other information we can gather to
make an educated guess about the future financial performance of the firm. Historical figures provide a
reasonable starting point. We use tools such as ratios, common size, and trend analysis to fine-tune our
forecast. And finally, we assess what we know about the firm, its competitors, the economy, and anything else
that might impact performance and further fine-tune our forecast from there.
It’s important to take a moment to consider the role of ethics in forecasting. Ethics is a huge issue in the world
of accounting and finance in general, and forecasting is no different. There can be tremendous pressure on
management to perform, to deliver certain levels of profit, and to meet shareholder expectations.
Forecasting, as you will learn throughout this chapter, is not an exact science. There is a great deal of
subjectivity that can come into play when forecasting sales and expenses. Ethical behavior is crucial in this
area. Those who create forecasts must have a firm understanding of where their data comes from, how
reliable it is, and whether or not their assumptions and projections are reasonably justified.
Financial Statement Foundations
InFinancial Statements, you were introduced to a firm called Clear Lake Sporting Goods. You learned about
the four key financial statements: theincome statement,balance sheet,statement of stockholders’
equity, andstatement of cash flows. Each one provides a different view of the firm’s financial health and
performance.
Clear Lake Sporting Goodsis a small merchandising company (a company that buys finished goods and sells
them to consumers) that sells hunting and fishing gear. It uses financial statements to understand its
profitability and current financial position, to manage cash flow, and to communicate its finances to outside
parties such as investors, governing bodies, and lenders. We will use Clear Lake’s company information and
historical financial statements in this chapter as we explore its forecasting process. It’s important to note that
in this chapter, we are focusing on just one firm and the one method its managers have chosen to forecast
financial performance. There are a variety of types of firms in actual application, and they may choose to
forecast their financial performance differently. We are demonstrating just one approach here.
The balance sheet shows all the firm’s assets, liabilities, and equity at one point in time. It also supports the
accounting equation in a very clear and transparent way. We find one section of the balance sheet contains all
current and noncurrent assets that must total the other section of the balance sheet: total liabilities and
equity. InFigure 18.2, we see that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has total assets of $250,000 in the current year,
which balances with its total liabilities and equity of $250,000.

Figure18.2Balance Sheet
The income statement reflects the performance of the firm over a period of time. It includes net sales, cost of
goods sold, operating expenses, and net income. InFigure 18.3, we see that Clear Lake had $120,000 in net
sales, $60,000 in cost of goods sold, and $35,000 in net income in the current year.
Figure18.3Full Income Statement
Finally, the statement of cash flows is used to reconcile net income to cash balances. The statement begins
with net income, then reflects adjustments to balance sheet accounts and noncash expenses. The statement of
18.1 • The Importance of Forecasting537

cash flows is broken down into three key categories: operating, investing, and financing. This allows users to
clearly see what elements of the business are generating or using cash. InFigure 18.4, we see that Clear Lake
had cash flow fromoperating activitiesof $53,600, cash used forinvesting activitiesof ($18,600), and cash
used forfinancing activitiesof ($15,000).
Figure18.4Statement of Cash Flows
Another key concept to remember about the financial statements is that the statement of cash flows is
necessary to truly understand how the firm is using and generating cash. A common misconception is that if a
firm reports net income on its income statement, then it must have plenty of cash, and if it reports a loss, it
must be short on cash. Although this can be true, it’s not necessarily the case. Historically speaking, we need
the statement of cash flows to get the full picture of how cash was used or generated in the past. Looking to
the future, we need a cash flow forecast to plan for possible gaps in cash flow and, potentially, how to make
the best use of any cash surplus. Throughout this chapter, we will see how to use historical financial
statements to help develop the future cash forecast.
It’s also important to remember that the four financial statements are tied together. Net income from the
income statement feeds into retained earnings, which live on the balance sheet. Equity balances on the
balance sheet feed information to the statement of stockholders’ equity. And information from both the
income statement (net income and noncash expenses) and the balance sheet (changes in working capital
accounts) all feed into the statement of cash flows. These relationships will be helpful to understand when
using historical statements and preparing forecasts.
Balance Sheet Analysis
Fully understanding the items that are on the balance sheet and how they relate to one another and to other
financial statements will help you create a financial forecast. InFinancial Statements, you learned that on the
classified balance sheet, both assets and liabilities are broken down into current and noncurrent categories.
You also know that the balance sheet must live up to its name—it must balance. This means that total assets
(what the company owns) must equal total liabilities and equity (what the company owes).

You continued your financial statement development inMeasures of Financial Health, where you saw how to
use elements of the balance sheet to assess financial health. Ratios based on balance sheet accounts can be
useful for understanding relationships between balance sheet items—how they related in the past and then, in
forecasting, how those relationships might change or remain the same in the future. Examples of balance
sheet ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, debt-to-assets ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio.
InFinancial Statements, you also explored common-size analysis. To prepare acommon-sizeanalysis of the
balance sheet, every item on the statement must be expressed as a percentage of total assets. Seeing each
item as a percentage—that is, seeing its relationship to total assets—is also helpful for assessing historical
statements and how those percentages or relationships can be used to predict future balances in the forecast.
For example, inFigure 18.5, you can see that Clear Lake’s current assets represented 80% of its total assets in
both the current and prior years.
Figure18.5Common-Size Balance Sheet
Income Statement Analysis
Like balance sheet analysis, income statement analysis is also quite helpful in preparing for the forecasting
process. InFinancial Statements, you learned that the income statement is commonly broken down into a few
sections. Cost of goods sold is deducted from net sales to arrive at gross margin. Gross margin refers to the
profits earned solely on the sale of the product itself, without consideration for the expenses incurred to run
the business. Next, operating expenses are deducted to reflect operating income. Operating income reflects
the profits of the core business function. Finally, other items, such as interest expense, tax expense, and other
gains and losses, are deducted to arrive at net income, a.k.a. thebottom line. Each segment of the income
statement is helpful for assessing past performance and estimating future expenses for a forecast.
You continued your financial statement development inMeasures of Financial Health, where you saw how to

use elements of the income statement to assess historical financial performance. Ratios based on the income
statement can be useful for understanding relationships between net sales and expenses—how they related in
the past and then, in forecasting, how those relationships might change or remain the same. Examples of
income statement ratios include gross margin, operating margin, and profit margin. Common ratios that
incorporate items from both the balance sheet and the income statement include return on assets (ROA),
return on equity (ROE), inventory turnover, accounts receivable turnover, and accounts payable turnover.

Performance Trends
Review the most recentannual report forBig 5 Sporting Goods(https://openstax.org/r/

and past two years. How is their performance? Are their sales trending up or down? Why might the
contribution margin have increased or decreased?
InFinancial Statements, you also explored common-size analysis. To prepare a common-size analysis of the
income statement, every item on the statement must be expressed as a percentage of net assets. Seeing each
item as a percentage, in terms of its relationship to total sales, is also helpful for assessing historical
statements and how those percentages or relationships can be used to predict future balances in the forecast.
For example, inFigure 18.6, you can see that Clear Lake’s cost of goods sold represented 50% of its net sales in
both the current and prior years.

18.2Forecasting Sales
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain how sales are the main driver for a financial forecast.
•Determine a past time period to formulate the basis for a financial forecast.
•Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using past data to forecast future financial performance.
•Calculate past sales growth averages.
•Justify adjusting relationships when forecasting future financial performance.
In this section of the chapter, you will begin to explore the first step of creating a forecast: forecasting sales.
We will discuss common time frames for sales forecasts and why we use historical data in our forecasts (but
only with caution), and we will work through the process of forecasting future sales. We will be using the
percent-of-sales method to forecast some expenses for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the example used
throughout the chapter. This method relies on sales data, further highlighting why accuracy in forecasting
sales is crucial.
Sales as the Driver
A significant portion of a business’s costs are driven by how much it sells. Thus, the sales forecast is the
necessary first step in preparing a financial forecast. Common costs driven by sales include direct product
costs, direct labor costs, and other key variable costs (i.e., costs that vary proportionately to sales), such as
sales commissions.
Looking to the Past
Forecasting sales is not always an easy task, as no one knows the future. We can, however, use the information
we do have to forecast future sales with the greatest accuracy possible. Most firms start by looking at the past.
A firm may look at past sales from a variety of prior periods. It’s common to look at the past 12 months to
estimate the coming 12 months. Looking at 12 consecutive months helps identify seasonality of sales trends,
what time of year sales tend to drop off and when they increase, possible sales spikes that might reoccur, and
any other trends that tend to appear over a 12-month period. InFigure 18.7, we see Clear Lake’s sales by
month for the past 12 months.
Past data is often used in conjunction with probabilities and weighted average calculations derived from
probabilities. Though used in several areas of forecasting, this approach is particularly common in drafting the
sales forecast. Using multiple scenarios and the probability of each scenario occurring is a common approach
to estimating future sales.
Figure18.7Historical Sales Data
We can see at first glance that sales remain fairly steady from January to April. Sales then goes up significantly
in April and May, seem to peak in June, taper off a bit in July, then decline steeply from August to the end of the
year, with the lowest sales being in November and December. Though not exact, it’s easy to quickly see that
sales follow a seasonal pattern. We will focus on just one year of data here to keep things simple. However, it’s
important to note that when a firm has a seasonal sales pattern, it normally uses more than one year of data
to detect and evaluate the pattern. It’s not uncommon for firms to have a seasonal sales pattern that
fluctuates based on an external factor such as weather patterns, patterns in business or demand, or other
18.2 • Forecasting Sales541

factors such as holidays. Common examples might include farm-based businesses that function on a weather
pattern for harvesting and selling crops or a toy company that fluctuates around gift-giving holidays.
This knowledge is helpful when assembling a first pass at the next year’s sales forecast. Using common-size
and horizontal (trend) analyses on sales is also helpful, as shown inFigure 18.8. We can see the exact
percentages that sales went up or down each month:
•In January, the company had sales of $9,000, which wasof the total annual sales.
•In June, the company had $19,000 sales, which wasof the total annual sales and
of January sales.
Figure18.8Historical Sales Data as Percentages
Once a baseline in the 12-month period is assessed, it can also be helpful to look for trends in other ways. For
example, the past several years might be assessed to see if there is a trend in total growth or decline for those
years on a summary basis or by period. Clear Lake Sporting Goods had sales in the current year of $126,000, in
the prior year of $105,000, and two years ago of $89,000. This reflects a 20% increase and an 18% increase,
respectively. It might be reasonable to expect a roughly 18 to 20% increase in total sales in the future with only
this information in mind. Keep in mind that we will learn about many other factors to consider in the forecast,
so the 18 to 20% increase is a good general guideline to consider along with other factors.
THINK IT THROUGH
Sales Forecast for Big 5 Sporting Goods
Review the2020 annual report forBig 5 Sporting Goods(https://openstax.org/r/
2020_annual_report_for_Big_5_Sporting_Goods). Locate the consolidated statements of operations on page
F-7. Using the company’s net sales figures for the current and prior years, what percentage might you
recommend for their sales forecast for the next year?
Solution:
Big 5’s sales for 2020 and 2019 were $1,041,212,000 and $996,495,000, respectively. This represents a 4.5%
growth from the prior year. Forecasted sales, based solely on this information, might be appropriate at
4.5% growth for the next year, keeping in mind that many other factors should also be considered along
with this information. Historical sales are only one set of data to use as a starting point.
Looking atFigure 18.9, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods decides to take its first pass at a forecast using
the more conservative estimate of 18% total sales growth. The company could consider last year’s sales of
$126,000 and increase them by 18% to arrive at total forecasted sales for next year of
. Next, to get the monthly sales, the company could use the same percent of the
total for each month that it did for the previous year. For example, sales in January of last year were 7.1% of
the full year’s sales. To find the forecast for the next year, the company would take the forecasted sales of
$148,680 for the year and multiply that by 7.1% to get $10,620 for January. The process is repeated for each
54218 • Financial Forecasting
Access for free at openstax.org

month to get the full year.
Figure18.9Forecasted Sales Data
Keep in mind that this is only a starting point. These estimates will be reviewed, assessed, and updated as
more information and other factors are taken into consideration.
It can also be helpful to look at a shorter period, perhaps just the last few months, on a more detailed basis (by
department, by customer, etc.) to see if there are any possible new trends beginning to develop that might be
an indicator of performance in the coming year. For example, Clear Lake Sporting Goods might look at
detailed sales records for October, November, and December and see that it had an old product line that was
discontinued in early October, which contributed to a 2% reduction in monthly sales. This reduction in monthly
sales will likely continue into the new year until the new line the company has signed on begins arriving in
stores. Thus, the management team feels they should reduce their first quarter monthly estimates by 2%, as
reflected inFigure 18.10. January is now, for example.
Figure18.10Adjusted Forecasted Sales Data
Changes for the Future
It’s important to note that the past is not always a reliable predictor of the future. Circumstances can often
change to make the future quite different from the past. The business itself may change, the economy can
change, the customer base may undergo a shift in demographics or a change in buying habits, new
competition may emerge, and so on. So while past performance is helpful, it is only one step in the process of
forecasting sales.

Most firms first look to the past to target some form of baseline estimate for the coming year; then, managers
begin making adjustments based on what they know about the future. Assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods
will be adding a new brand to its collection of fishing supplies in March. The manufacturer plans to begin
running its commercials in late February, which managers anticipate will increase Clear Lake’s monthly sales

by about $500 in March, $1,000 in April, $1,400 in May, and $2,000 per month in June, July, and August. We see
the monthly adjustments to Clear Lake’s latest sales forecast inFigure 18.11. March, for example, is now
$10,908 ($10,408 prior estimate plus $500 increase from new brand).
Figure18.11Forecasted Sales Data with New Brand
What we have discussed here are only some brief examples of the myriad factors that might impact a sales
budget for the coming year. It’s critical that all members of the team take the time and effort to research their
customers and the factors that impact their business in order to effectively assess the impact of these factors
on future sales. Though only two adjustments were made here, it’s likely that a large firm would have to
consider many, many factors that would ultimately impact monthly sales figures before arriving at a
conclusion.
18.3Pro Forma Financials
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define pro forma in the context of a financial forecast.
•Describe the factors that impact the length of a financial forecast.
•Explain the risks associated with a financial forecast.
In this section of the chapter, we will move beyond the sales forecast and look at the general nature, length,
and timeline of forecasts and the risks associated with using them. We’ll look at why we use them, how long
they generally are, what the key variables in a forecast are, and how we pair those variables with common-size
analysis to develop the forecast.
Purpose of a Forecast
As mentioned earlier in the chapter, forecasts serve different purposes depending on who is using them. Our
focus here, however, is the world of finance. In this realm, the key purpose ofpro forma(future-looking)
financial statements is to manage a firm’s cash flow and assess the overall value that the firm is generating
through future sales growth. Growing just for the sake of growing doesn’t always yield favorable income for
the firm. A larger top-line sales figure that results in lower net income doesn’t make sense in the grand
scheme of things. The same is true of profitable sales that don’t generate enough cash flows at the right time.
The firm may make a profit, but if it doesn’t manage the timing of its cash flows, it could be forced to shut
down if it can’t cover the costs of payroll or keep the lights on. Forecasting helps assess both cash flow and the
profitability of future growth. Managers can forecast cash flow using data from forecasted financial
statements; this allows them to identify potential gaps in cash and plan ahead in order to either alter collection
and payment policies or obtain funding to cover the gap in the timing of cash flows.

Access for free at openstax.org

Length of a Forecast
Forecasts can generally be for any length of time. The length generally depends on the user’s needs. A one-
year forecast, broken down by month, is quite typical. A firm will often go through a formal budgeting process
near the end of its calendar or fiscal year to project financial plans and goals for the coming year. Once that is
done, a rolling financial forecast is then done monthly to adjust as time moves on, more information becomes
available, and circumstances change.
To be useful, the future forecast for financial planning purposes is almost always calculated as monthly
increments rather than one total figure for the next 12 months. Breaking the data down by month allows
finance managers to more clearly see fluctuations in cash flows in and out, identify potential gaps in cash flow,
and plan ahead for their cash needs.
Forecasts can also be done for several years into the future. In fact, they commonly are. However, once the
firm is looking out beyond 12 months, it gets difficult to forecast items with a great degree of accuracy. Often,
forecasts beyond a year will be completed only to quarterly or even annual figures rather than monthly.
Forecasts that far into the future are often strategic in nature, made more to communicate future plans for the
firm than for more detailed decision-making and cash flow planning.
Common-Size Financials
As we saw earlier in the chapter, common-size analysis involves using historical financial statements as a basis
for future forecasts. Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the
relationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and
line items on the balance sheet.
For example, inFigure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,
in the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%
of their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as
accurately as possible is also important.
Select Variables to Use
A simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements
and forecast every item using historical percentages. It’s a logical way to begin a very rough draft of the
forecast. However, several variables should be taken into consideration. First, managers must address the cost
of an account and determine if it’s a variable or fixed item. Variable costs tend to vary directly and
proportionally with production or sales volume. Common examples include direct labor and direct materials.
Fixed costs, on the other hand, do not change when production or sales volume increases or decreases within
the relevant range. Granted, if production were to increase or decrease by a large amount, fixed costs would
indeed change. However, in normal month-to-month changes, fixed costs often remain the same. Common
examples of fixed costs include rent and managerial salaries.
So, if we were to approach our common-size income statement, for example, we would likely use the
percentage of sales as a starting point to forecast variable items such as cost of goods sold. However, fixed
costs may not be accurately forecast as a percentage of sales because they won’t actually change with sales.
Thus, we would likely look at the history of the dollar values of fixed costs in order to forecast them.
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
COVID-19 Makes Forecasting Difficult for Big 5 Sporting Goods
Big 5 Sporting Goods announced record earnings in the third quarter of 2020, attributing its huge success
that quarter to the impact of people’s reactions to theCOVID-19pandemic. With so many people in
18.3 • Pro Forma Financials545

quarantine still wanting to make healthy lifestyle choices, sporting goods stores were making record sales.
Record-breaking sales, however, are not certain in the future. The impacts of the pandemic are extremely
difficult to predict, making it a challenge for Big 5 Sporting Goods and other companies to assemble pro
forma financial statements.

Determine Potential Changes in Variables
So far, we have focused on using historical common-size statements to create a draft (not a final version) of
the forecast. This is because the past isn’t always a perfect indicator of the future, and our finances don’t
always follow a linear pattern. We use the past as a good starting point; then, we must assess what else we
know to fine-tune and make adjustments to the forecast.
Many items impact the forecast, and they will vary from one organization to another. The key is to do research,
gather data, and look around at the market, the economy, the competition, and any other factors that have the
potential to impact the future sales, costs, and financial health of the company. Though certainly not an
exhaustive list, here are a few examples of items that may impact Clear Lake Sporting Goods.
•It has an old product line that was discontinued in early October, contributing to a 2% reduction in
monthly sales that will likely continue into the new year until a new line begins arriving in stores.
•It will be adding a new brand to its collection of fishing supplies in March. The manufacturer plans to
begin running commercials in late February. Managers anticipate that this will increase Clear Lake’s
monthly sales by about $500 in March, $1,000 in April, $1,400 in May, and $2,000 per month in June, July,
and August.
•The company has just finished updating its employee compensation package. It goes into effect in January
of the new year and will result in an overall 4% increase in the cost of labor.
•The landlord indicated that rent will increase by $50 per month starting July 1.
•Some fixed assets will be fully depreciated by the end of March. Thus, depreciation expense will go down
by $25 per month beginning in April.
•There are rumors of new regulations that will impact the costs of importing some of the more difficult-to-
obtain hunting supplies. Managers aren’t entirely sure of the full impact of the new legislation at this time,
but they anticipate that it could increase cost of goods sold for the affected product line when the new
legislation goes into effect in the last quarter. Their best estimate is that it could increase the overall cost
of goods sold by up to 2%.
We will use all of this data later in the chapter when we are ready to compile a complete forecast for Clear
Lake.

In this section of the chapter, we will tie together what we have learned so far about forecasting sales,
54618 • Financial Forecasting
Access for free at openstax.org

common-size analysis, and using what we know about the company and its environment to create a full set of
pro forma (forward-looking or forecasted) financial statements.
Forecast the Income Statement
To arrive at a fully forecasted income statement, we use historical income statements, common-size income
statements, and any additional information we have about future sales and costs, such as the effects of the
economy and competition. As we saw earlier in the chapter, we begin with forecasted sales because they are
the basis for many of the forecasted costs.
Let’s begin with the sales forecast for Clear Lake Sporting Goods that we saw earlier in the chapter, inFigure
18.9, and use it along with the prior year income statement by month shown inFigure 18.12. We will consider
other data we have about the business to begin creating a full income statement (seeFigure 18.13).
Figure18.12Prior Year Monthly Income Statement by Month
The first two key points regarding product lines have already been built into the sales forecast. Notice that the
cost of goods sold was 50% in the prior year. However, based on possible future legislation, to be conservative,
we should increase the cost of goods sold by 2% in the last quarter of the year. Thus, we will forecast cost of
goods sold at 50% of sales in the first nine months and increase it to 52% in the last three months of the year.
Rent is a fixed cost that historically amounts to $458 per month. However, we know that the landlord is
increasing rent by $50 starting on July 1. Thus, we will forecast rent at the same fixed cost of $458 per month
for the first six months and increase it to $508 per month for the second half of the year.
Depreciation, also a fixed cost, was historically $300 per month. However, we know that depreciation expense
will go down by $25 beginning in April. Thus, we forecast depreciation at $300 for the first three months and at
$275 for the last 9 months.
Salaries expense has historically been $450 per month. However, we know that the company is implementing a
new compensation program on January 1 that will increase salaries expense by 4% ($18). Thus, we will forecast
salaries for the whole year at $468.
Utilities expense seems to vary somewhat by sales from month to month, as shops are open longer hours
during their busy season. However, the total utilities expense is not expected to change for the coming year.
Thus, the forecast for utilities expense remains at $2,500, broken down by month as a percentage of sales.
Interest expense is a fixed cost and isn’t anticipated to change. Thus, the same $167 interest expense per
month is forecast for the coming year.
18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast547

Finally, income tax expense is forecasted as a percentage of operating income because tax liability is incurred
as a direct result of operating income.Figure 18.13shows the next 12 months’ forecast for Clear Lake Sporting
Goods using all of this data.
Figure18.13Forecasted Income Statement
Forecast the Balance Sheet
Now that we have a reasonable income statement forecast, we can move on to the balance sheet. The balance
sheet, however, is entirely different from the income statement. It requires a bit more research and additional
assumptions. Just like the income statement, it’s often a work in progress. A first draft is a good starting point,
but adjustments must be made once it is created, and all the interrelationships between the statements, cash
flow in particular, are taken into consideration.
The balance sheet is a bit more difficult to forecast because the statement reflects balances at just a given
point in time. Account balances change daily, so forecasting just one snapshot in time for each month can be a
challenge. A good starting point is to assess general company financial policies or rules of thumb. For
example, assume that Clear Lake pays most of its vendors on net 30-day terms. A good way to forecast
accounts payable on the balance sheet might be to add up the cost of goods sold from the forecasted income
statement for the prior month. For example, inFigure 18.14, we see that Clear Lake has forecasted its accounts
payable for March as the cost of goods sold in March from its forecasted income statement.
For accounts receivable, Clear Lake generally receives payment from customers within net 90-day terms. Thus,
it uses the sum of the current and prior two months’ forecasted sales to estimate its accounts receivable
balance.
Inventory will vary throughout the year. For the first six months, the company tries to build inventory for four
months of sales. Once the busy season hits, inventory goes down to three months’ worth of future sales, then
finally drops to only two months of sales in December. Thus, managers use their sales forecast by month to
estimate their inventory ending balance each month.
The equipment balance is forecasted by reducing the prior month’s balance by the forecasted depreciation
expense on the forecasted income statement.
Unearned revenue is historically around 50% of the current month’s sales. Thus, Clear Lake estimates its
unearned revenue balance each month by taking the current month’s net sales from the forecasted income
statement and multiplying it by 50%.
Short-term investments, notes payable, and common stock are not anticipated to change, so the current
balance is forecasted to remain the same for the next 12 months.

Access for free at openstax.org

To forecast the ending balance for retained earnings for each month, managers add the monthly net income
from the forecasted balance sheet to the prior balance and subtract a quarterly $10,000 dividend.
Once all of these accounts are completed, the balance sheet is out of balance. Given that all of these events
are somewhat related but are not tied together dollar for dollar, it’s not surprising when the forecasted
balance sheet is finished and does not balance. To complete the first draft (seeFigure 18.14), the cash account
is used as a variable and plugged in to make the balance sheet balance. Notice that by the end of the year, the
company has $59,905 in cash. However, look at what happens midyear—the cash account falls to only $8,782.
In the next section, we will generate a cash flow forecast, which will allow Clear Lake to update its balance
sheet forecast once it estimates what it will do to cover the cash flow gaps.
Figure18.14Forecasted Balance Sheet Draft
Linkages between the Forecasted Balance Sheet and the Income Statement
Notice that in the discussion in the prior section on the balance sheet forecast, a lot of the information in the
forecasted income statement was used to generate the forecasted balance sheet. The balance sheet accounts
generally depend on activity reported in the income statement. For example, for many firms, the balance in
their accounts receivable account is tied to their sales. Looking at historical balances in the accounts receivable
account and how those relate to historical sales will help determine how to use the forecasted future sales to
estimate the future balance of accounts receivable.
The same is true of accounts payable. Looking at past balances, past expenses (normally cost of goods sold),
and the firm’s payment terms for its vendors allows managers to use forecasted cost of goods sold or other
expenses to estimate the balance in the accounts payable account.
We learned inFinancial Statementsthat net income flows into retained earnings. Thus, the net income from
the forecasted income statement can be used to help estimate the ending balance in retained earnings. If the
firm intends to issue any dividends in the coming year, managers should also estimate that reduction in their
forecast.
It’s also common to find other general policies or procedures that help drive performance and aid in
forecasting balances. For example, if the company has a goal of maintaining a certain level of inventory or a
minimum balance in its cash account, that information can be used to guide the estimate for those accounts.

18.5Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Generate a cash flow forecast.
•Assess a cash flow forecast to determine future cash funding needs.
•Use pro forma financial statements and cash flow forecasts to assess the value of growth to the firm.
In this section of the chapter, we will use the forecasted income statement, forecasted balance sheet, and
other information we know about the firm’s policies and goals for the coming year to generate and assess a
cash flow forecast.
Create a Cash Flow Forecast
A cash flow forecast isn’t overly complex, yet it is not easy to assemble because it requires making many
assumptions about the future. Acash forecastbegins with the beginning cash balance, adds anticipated cash
inflows, and deducts anticipated cash outflows. This identifies cash surpluses and shortages.
For Clear Lake Sporting Goods, for example, we see inFigure 18.15that the company begins with cash of
$42,581,000 in January of the new year. Next, it lists the cash inflows, or cash received from customers. Given
the assumption that customers pay in 90-day terms, the cash flow is filled in by plugging in the sales forecast
for the three prior months. For example, the cash flow from customers of $10,508 for June is the same as the
net sales forecast for March (seeFigure 18.13).
Figure18.15Forecasted Cash Inflows
Next, Clear Lake identifies cash outflows, which include accounts payable, salaries, rent, utilities, dividends,
and interest payments. Accounts payable are normally paid within 30 days, so the forecast for cost of goods
sold for the prior month is used as an estimate of amount paid for payables. For example, inFigure 18.16, we
see that the accounts payable settled in June of $8,610 is the cost of goods sold for May from the forecasted
income statement.
Salaries are paid monthly and thus represent the same recurring monthly cash outflow, as does rent. Utilities,
like accounts payable, are assumed to be paid within 30 days. Thus, the cash outflow for utilities is the utilities
expense for the prior month from the forecasted income statement.
Management intends to pay a quarterly dividend of $10,000. Thus, inFigure 18.16, we see $10,000 cash
outflows forecasted for March, June, September, and December. Interest on the long-term liability is paid
quarterly. Thus, the $500 cash outflows in March, June, September, and December are simply the monthly
interest expense of $167 from the income statement, summed for each quarter.

Figure18.16Forecasted Cash Inflows and Outflows
Using a Cash Forecast to Determine Additional Funds Needed
Finally, at the end of the cash flow forecast, cash outflows are subtracted from the cash inflows. This identifies
whether acash surplus(extra) orcash deficit(not enough) exists for each month. For example, inFigure
18.17, we see that in March, Clear Lake is forecasting $4,800 of cash inflows and $17,800 of total cash outflows,
which results in a cash deficit of $13,000.
Clear Lake has a general policy to not let its cash balance fall below $35,000. Thus, managers need to assess
their monthly balances and potential deficits and identify months when financing is necessary. For example,
the deficit of $13,000 in March is enough to push the cash balance lower than $35,000. Thus, it’s estimated that
the company will need $5,000 in short-term financing in March. It has an estimated surplus in April, so $3,000
of the borrowing is returned.
Figure18.17Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit
Assessing the Value of Growth
It’s a fairly common assumption that most, if not all, businesses want to grow. While it certainly can be good
as a firm to grow in size, growth just for the sake of growth isn’t necessarily a good goal. A firm can grow in
size based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth
will increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations
takes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it
18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth551

would require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more
manpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a
cash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and
balance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the
extent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.
For example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales
in its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot
traffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by
running the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a
cash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would
require payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers
look at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the
move would be profitable. Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast
with formulas that tie together, makingscenario analysissuch as this a much easier process.
Scenarios in Forecasting
Forecasting is almost never a linear process. In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first
draft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are
assessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to
complete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting
or forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to
the firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or
one variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.
Often, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a
“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a
recession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future
states and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to
increase.
Assume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain
average. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if
the economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of
the prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and
variable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement. InFigure 18.18, we can see that net income
would drop to $16,391 under this assumption, compared to the net income of $47,653 forecasted under
average economy assumptions inFigure 18.13.

Figure18.18Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit
Though creating a full forecast inExcelcan be a bit complex, it is a powerful tool that is useful for analysis.
Elements can be used to vary just about anything, from something small such as a 1% increase in the cost of a
product to a company-wide increase in salaries, the introduction of an entire new product line, or the purchase
of a new production machine, among other possibilities.
For example, assume that Clear Lake has completed a first pass at its forecast and is reviewing the forecasted
profit for the next 12 months. Managers feel the profit is currently low, as they always want to target a certain
percentage. They might tinker with variables in the forecast file to see the impact on profits of potential
changes they are considering. They may reduce the new salaries package by a percentage point to see if it
gets them closer to their goal. They may adjust cost of goods sold by a certain percentage if they feel they can
negotiate with vendors to work down their costs. They may adjust rent and see if they can find a better retail
location to either reduce costs or increase sales due to increased foot traffic in a new location. They may save
an entirely new version of the forecast and change it drastically to see what investing in opening a second
retail location would do.
As you can see, the list of possibilities is endless. Though the main goal of financial managers may be cash
planning, the power of a well-developed forecast is tremendous. It can help assess potential growth, new
opportunities, and even small changes in the business as well.
Sensitivity Analysis in Forecasting
Sensitivity analysiswill often look at the change in just one variable rather than the entire scenario. It
examines how sensitive a particular output (commonly net income) will be to a change in a particular
underlying input (sales or costs, for example). What if sales are 10% more or less than forecasted? What if the
prices the firm can charge its customers are 10% more or less? What if the cost of goods sold increases by
10%? The purpose is to see which variables are crucial to “get right.” It isn’t worth spending a lot of research
dollars to make sure you are accurately predicting a variable if that variable won’t notably change the
outcome. However, a slight change in other variables may have significant impact.
Using pro forma financial statements created in Excel allows management to quickly generate new pro forma
financials and see the impact that each possible variable might have on the overall financial results.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Generate a financial statement forecast using spreadsheet tools.
•Connect the balance sheet and income statement using appropriate formula referencing.
•Use spreadsheet functions to generate appropriate iterations that balance financial forecasts.
Throughout this chapter, we have seen forecasted financial statements for Clear Lake Sporting Goods along
with its forecasted cash flow. These statements could all have been generated by hand, of course, but that
wouldn’t be an effective use of time. As mentioned in prior sections, several different types of software can be
quite effective in making the forecasting process faster and more flexible. In this section, we will review just
one common option, Microsoft Excel.

Excel exhibits.
Using the “Sheet”
Creating a budget in Excel can be very simple or extremely complex, depending on the size and complexity of
the business and the number of formulas and dependencies that are written into the Excel workbook.
Creating the forecast in Excel follows the same steps and flow we just explored in this chapter but with the
power of a software program to do the math for you. We begin with the sales forecast, which uses several key
formulas in Excel.
1.First, sales are projected to be 18% higher than the prior year. Thus, a total projection for the year is
calculated using a simple link and multiplication function tied to last year’s total sales. InFigure 18.19, you
can see the formula in cell O4 is “='Figure 18.12'!N4*1.18”. This formula simply does the math to increase
the prior year’s sales by 18%.
2.Next, the sales are distributed by month. InFigure 18.19, we see in cell B5 that the forecasted income
statement sheet is linked to the percent of annual sales from the Prior Year Income Statement (Figure
18.12) sheet. Then, in cell B4, January sales are estimated with a formula that multiplies the total
forecasted sales in O4 by the percent of annual sales for January of the prior year. Notice that the formula
then multiplies that product by 0.98. This is because Clear Lake discontinued a product line in the last
quarter of the prior year, and management feels that this will reduce sales in the first quarter of the new
year by roughly 2%.
Figure18.19Forecasted Sales Formulas in Excel
3.As Clear Lake continues to fill out its forecasted income statement, the next formula we see is a simple
sum formula to calculate net sales in B8 (seeFigure 18.20). It’s a simple formula that subtracts sales
returns and allowances in B7 from gross sales in B4. Similar formulas are also found in B10 for gross
margin and B18 for net income.
4.In cell B9, we see a multiplication formula that multiplies sales from B4 by 0.5, or 50%. This is because
55418 • Financial Forecasting
Access for free at openstax.org

management feels that cost of goods sold will remain the same as last year, in most quarters at least, and
last year’s percentage was 50%.
5.Rent, depreciation, and salaries are all simply typed in, as they are fixed expenses that remain the same as
last year.
6.The utilities calculation, found in cell B14, is somewhat similar to the sales calculation. The total utilities
expense from O14 is multiplied by the current month’s sales in B4 divided by the total annual sales in O4.
This spreads out the utility cost by month based on the percentage of annual sales.
Figure18.20Forecasted Income Statement Formulas
Clear Lake’s forecasted balance sheet ties very closely to both the forecasted income statement and the prior
year’s income statement. InFigure 18.21, we see in C7 an addition formula using the sum of the current
month and three months of prior sales as an estimate of the ending accounts receivable balance. The formula
for inventory is similar but forward looking. In C8, inventory is estimated by adding the cost of goods sold for
the current month and next three months from the forecasted income statement.
Total current assets in C10 is calculated with a SUM formula that adds together the values in all the selected
cells. Amounts such as short-term investments and common stock that are not anticipated to change are
simply typed as a number in the cell. Much like in the income statement, subtotals are found in C13 for total
assets, C17 for current liabilities, C24 for total equity, and C25 for total liabilities and equity. Retained earnings
in C23 pulls the ending retained earnings balance from the end of last year (hidden in column B) and adds the
18.6 • Using Excel to Create the Long-Term Forecast555

net income for January in the forecasted income statement to get the current month’s ending balance.
Figure18.21Forecasted Balance Sheet Formulas
Much like the balance sheet, the cash forecast also relies heavily on data from the forecasted income
statement as well as the forecasted balance sheet. To begin the year, inFigure 18.22, we see that the formula
in B4 pulls the cash balance from the forecasted balance sheet. In B6, the formula pulls the sales for the three
months prior from the previous year’s income statement. This is because it’s assumed that cash is collected
from customers 90 days after the sale. The same approach is used for accounts payable, rent, salaries, and
utilities. The formulas pull the expenses from a prior month depending on the assumed timing for payment.
Utilities, for example, are assumed to be paid within 30 days, so the cash outflow in February is assumed to be
the utilities expense for January from the forecasted income statement. Note that interest payments are
assumed to be zero in January and February, but in March, the formula in D14 sums the interest expenses on
the forecasted income statement for January, February, and March. This is because interest is paid quarterly.
Finally, note the formula in C4. The beginning cash balance for a given month is the same as the ending cash
balance from the prior month; thus, the figure in B18 is linked to C4 to start the new month.

Figure18.22Cash Forecast Formulas
Using Excel Functions to Balance
Once we get a draft of the forecasts outlined, then the tinkering starts. Additional information can be used to
adjust the formulas, as we saw with the 2% reduction in January sales for the forecasted income statement.
Because we have linked most (though not all) of our expenses, subtotals, and statements together using
formulas, management can also use the forecast workbook to perform scenario and sensitivity analyses,
essentially asking “what if?” and looking at the results. When completed, however, before finalizing the
forecast, it’s important that the financial statements are in balance (particularly thebalance sheet, just as the
name implies).
Notice that throughout, we used formulas to calculate subtotals to ensure they are correct and change as
needed. We also linked figures, such as the ending and beginning cash balances, to ensure they are in balance.
Perhaps the easiest but most important thing to do is to ensure that the balance sheet balances. We can do
this with a simple formula that compares total assets to total liabilities and equity. We can see inFigure 18.23
that subtracting one from the other in cell C27 should result in $0. If there is a difference, the formula will
highlight it, forcing us to investigate and correct the sheet so that it balances.

Summary
18.1The Importance of Forecasting
Forecasting financial statements is important to different users for different reasons. In finance, it’s most
important for assessing the value of future growth plans and planning for future cash flow needs.
18.2Forecasting Sales
The sales forecast is the foundation on which much of the rest of the forecast is built. Thus, the sales forecast
is completed first. Historical sales data and any other information on the firm, its products, the economy, its
customers, and its competitors are all used to create the most accurate sales forecast possible.
18.3Pro Forma Financials
Pro forma financial statements are forward looking in nature. They use the sales forecast, historical data,
financial statement analyses, relationships between accounts and statements, and any other information
known about the firm, the environment, and the future to create the most accurate financial statement
forecast possible.
18.4Generating the Complete Forecast
Interrelationships among historical data, the forecasted income statement, and the forecasted balance sheet
are all used to estimate each line item in the financial statements.
18.5Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth
Once the income statement and balance sheet forecasts are complete, data from those statements,
information on company policies, and account relationships are used to generate a cash forecast. The cash
forecast is important for identifying any gaps in cash flow so that financial managers can plan for cash needs.
It’s also important to review not only the cash forecast but all forecasted financial statements to assess the
overall impact and value of proposed firm growth.
18.6Using Excel to Create the Long-Term Forecast
Excel can be a powerful tool for creating financial forecasts. Formulas that complete mathematical functions
and tie accounts and financial statements together are used to create the statements, ensure that they
balance, and facilitate scenario and sensitivity analyses.

Why It Matters
During theCOVID-19pandemic, many families and small businesses realized the importance of financial
resiliency. In personal finance, financial resiliency is the ability to overcome financial difficulties such as sudden
job loss or significant unexpected expenses—to spring back quickly.
To help promote resiliency, personal financial planners advise clients to maintain liquid assets equal to three
to six months of living expenses, keep debt levels low, manage the household budget, keep insurance in force
(health, property, and life), establish a solid credit history, and make wise use of credit cards and home equity
lines of credit.
In business finance, financial resiliency is not important only during pandemics but is important through the
ups and downs of seasonal cycles and economic downturns. Managing cash, accounts receivable, and
inventory while making optimal use of trade credit (accounts payable) makes for a business that meets its
operating needs and pays its debts when due.
Working capital management is also critical during good times. Even though profits might be rising, a business
with growing demand for its products and services still needs to have working capital management tools to
pay its bills. Growth in sales and profits do not immediately mean sufficient cash flow, so planning ahead with
tools such as a cash budget is key.
The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning

19 • Why It Matters565

19.1What Is Working Capital?
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Define working capital.
•Calculate a firm’s operating cycle and cash cycle.
•Compute inventory days, accounts receivable days, and accounts payable days.
The concept of business capital is often associated with the cash and assets (such as land and equipment) that
the owners contributed to the business. Early political economists like Adam Smith and Karl Marx identified
this concept of capital, along with labor and entrepreneurship, to be the factors of production.
That general idea of capital is important and critical to a company’s productive capacity. This chapter is about
a specific type of capital—working capital—that is just as important as long-term capital. Working capital
describes the resources that are needed to meet the daily, weekly, and monthly operating cash flow needs.
Employees are paid out of working capital as well as cash from operations, the fulfillment of merchandise
orders is possible because of working capital, and the liquidity of a company hinges upon how well
management plans and controls working capital.
Understanding working capital begins with the concept ofcurrent assets—those resources of a business that
are cash, near cash, or expected to be turned into cash within a year through the normal operations of the
business. Current assets are necessary for the everyday operation of the firm, and they are synonymous with
termgross working capital.
Cash is needed to pay the bills and meet the payroll. Excess cash is invested in cash alternatives such as
marketable securities, creatingliquiditythat can be tapped when operating cash flow needs exceed the
amount of cash on hand (checking account balances). Investment in inventory is necessary to meet the
demand for products (sales), and if the firm extends credit to its customers so that a sale can be made, the
balance sheet will also show accounts receivable—a very common current asset that derives its value from the
probability that customers will pay their bills.
Working capital is often spoken about in two versions:gross working capitalandnet working capital. As was
previously stated, gross working capital is equivalent to current assets, particularly those that are cash, cash-
like, or will be converted to cash within a short period of time (i.e., in less than one year).
Net working capital (NWC) is a more refined concept of working capital. It is best understood by examining its
formula:
Goal of Working Capital Management
The goal of working capital management is to maintain adequate working capital to
•meet the operational needs of the company;
•satisfy obligations (current liabilities) as they come due; and
•maintain an optimal level of current assets such as cash (provides no return), accounts receivable, and
inventory.
Working capital management encompasses all decisions involving a company’s current assets and current
liabilities. One very important aspect of working capital management is to provide enough cash to satisfy both
maturing short-term obligations and operational expenditures—keeping the company sufficiently liquid.
In summary, working capital management helps a company run smoothly and mitigates the risk of illiquidity.
Well-run companies make effective use of current liabilities to finance an optimal level of current assets and
maintain sufficient cash balances to meet short-term operating goals and to satisfy short-term obligations.
Working capital management is accomplished through
56619 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning

•cash management;
•credit and receivables management;
•inventory management; and
•accounts payable management.
Components of Working Capital Management
In contrast to net working capital, gross working capital is synonymous with current assets, particularly those
current assets that are either cash or cash equivalents or that will be converted to cash within a short period of
time (i.e., in less than one year).
Below is a list of the components of gross working capital.
•Cash and cash equivalents
•Marketable securities
•Accounts receivable
•Inventory
Here is an example. On December 31, a company has the following balances and gross working capital:
Think of the $1,105,000 of gross working capital as a source of funds for the most pressing obligations (i.e.,
current liabilities) of the company. Gross working capital is available to pay the bills. However, some of the
current assets would need to be converted to cash first. Accounts receivable need to be collected, and
inventory would need to be sold before it too can become cash. What if the company had $600,000 of current
liabilities? That amount of current obligations could not be paid out of cash until the marketable securities
were sold and a significant portion of accounts receivable were collected.
The second, more refined and useful concept of working capital isnet working capital:
For example, if a company has $1,000,000 of current assets and $750,000 of current liabilities, its net working
capital would be $250,000 ($1,000,000 less $750,000).
NWC provides a better picture because it takes into account the liability “coverage” provided by the current
assets. As the above example shows, the current assets would “cover” the current liabilities with an excess of
$250,000. Think of it this way: if the current assets could be converted to cash, they could be used to meet the
current obligations with another $250,000 of cash leftover.
Current liabilities include
•accounts payable;
•dividends payable;
•notes payable (due within a year);
•current portion of deferred revenue;
•current maturities of long-term debt;
•interest payable;
•income taxes payable; and
•accrued expenses such as compensation owed to employees.
Net working capital possibilities can be thought of as a spectrum from negative working capital to positive, as

there is no positive margin (safety

However, excessively high net

little cash and therefore an
opportunity cost (forgoing rates of
return on alternative investment).
Table19.1Spectrum of Net Working Capital
Measures of Financial Healthprovides information on a variety of financial ratios to help users of financial
statements understand the strengths and weakness of companies’ financial statements. Three of the financial
ratios covered in that chapter are brought back into this chapter’s discussion to demonstrate how financial
managers examine working capital and liquidity. Liquidity is the ease with which an asset can be converted
into cash. Thoseratiosare the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the cash ratio. A higher ratio indicates a
greater level of liquidity.
The formulas for the three liquidity ratios are:
Notice how the current ratio includes the two elements of net working capital—current assets and current
liabilities. It makes for a quick comparison of relative size or proportion.
THINK IT THROUGH
Current Ratio
A company has $2,000,000 of current assets, while its current liabilities are $1,000,000. What is the current
ratio, and what does it mean?
Solution:
The current ratio would bewhich is a 2:1 proportion of current asset value to
the amount of the current liabilities. This means that if all the current assets could be converted to cash,
then the current liabilities could be satisfied two times.
There are two drawbacks to the current ratio: (1) it is a working capital analytic as of a point in time but is not
indicative of future liquidity or future cash flows and (2) as an indicator of liquidity, it can be deceptive if a
significant proportion of the current assets are inventory, supplies, or prepaid expenses. Inventory is not very
liquid as it can take an extended time period to convert to cash, and assets such as supplies and prepaid
expenses never become cash and therefore are not a source of funds to pay bills.
The quick ratio is considered a more conservative indication of liquidity since it does not include a firm’s

Quick Ratio
A company’s current assets total $2,000,000, but $500,000 of that is inventory and the current liabilities total
$1,000,000. What is the quick ratio, and what does it mean?
Solution:
The quick ratio would beand would indicate a smaller cushion of net
working capital.
THINK IT THROUGH
Cash Ratio
The cash ratio is even more conservative in that it presents a picture of liquidity by excluding all current
assets except cash and marketable securities.
A company’s total current assets are $2,000,000, but only $1,100,000 of the current assets consist of cash
and marketable securities. Assuming $1,000,000 of current liabilities, what would be the cash ratio and what
does it mean?
Solution:
The cash ratio would beand the amount of cash is enough to pay the
current bills by $100,000.
Working capital ratios, like any financial ratio, are most valuable when examined in light of trends and in
comparison to industry/peer averages. For example, a deteriorating current ratio over several quarters (a
decline in the company’s current ratio) could indicate a reduced ability to pay bills.
Working capital ratios are also compared to industry averages, which are available in databases produced by
such financial publishers asDun & Bradstreet,Dow Jones Company, and theRisk Management Association
(RMA). These information services are available via subscriptions and through many libraries. For example, if a
company’s current ratio is 0.9 while the industry average is 2.0, then the company is less liquid than the
average company in its industry and strategies, and techniques need to be considered to change things and to
better compete with peer groups. Industry averages can be aspirational, motivating management to set
liquidity goals and best practices for working capital management.
It is common to think about working capital with a simple assumption: current assets are being “financed” by
current liabilities. However, such an assumption may be an oversimplification. Some level of current assets is
often necessary to meet longer-term obligations, and in that way, you could think of some amount of current
assets as a permanent based of working capital that may need to be financed with longer-term sources of
capital.
Think of a company with seasonal business. During busy times, more working capital will be needed than
during certain other portions of the year, such as less busy times. But there will always be some level—a
permanent base—of working capital needed. Think of it this way: the total working capital of many companies
will ebb and flow depending on many variables such as the operating cycle, production needs, and the growth
of revenue. Therefore, working capital can be thought of as having a permanent base that is always needed
19.1 • What Is Working Capital?569

and a total working capital amount that increases when activity levels (i.e., production and sales volume) are
higher (seeFigure 19.2).
The Cash Cycle
Thecash cycle, also called thecash conversion cycle, is the time period between when a business begins
production and acquires resources from its suppliers (for example, acquisition of materials and other forms of
inventory) and when it receives cash from its customers. This is offset by the time it takes to pay suppliers
(called the payables deferral period).
Figure19.2Working Capital Needs Can Vary: Temporary and Permanent Working Capital
The cash cycle is measured in days, and it is best understood by examining its formula:
The inventory conversion period is also called the days of inventory. It is the time (days) it takes to convert
inventory to sales and is calculated by following these steps:

Figure19.3Cash Conversion Cycle
Shortening the inventory conversion period and the receivables collection period or lengthening the payables
deferral period shortens the cash conversion cycle. Financial managers monitor and analyze each component
of the cash conversion cycle. Ideally, a company’s management should minimize the number of days it takes
to convert inventory to cash while maximizing the amount of time it takes to pay suppliers.
Quickly converting inventory to sales speeds up cash inflows and shortens the cash cycle, but it also could help
reduce inventory losses as a result of obsolescence. Inventory becomes obsolete because of a variety of
factors including time—inventory that has not been sold for a long period of time and is not expected to be
sold in the future has to be written down or written off according to accounting rules. Write-offs of inventory
can result in significant losses for a company. In the food business, inventory conversion periods take on great
importance because of spoilage of perishable goods; in retailing, seasonal items lose value the longer they
stay on the shelves.
Various inventory management techniques are used to shorten production time in manufacturing, and in
retailing, strategies are used to reduce the amount of time a product sits on the shelf or is stored in the
warehouse. Production techniques such asjust-in-time inventorysystems and marketing and pricing
strategies can have an impact on the number of days in the inventory conversion cycle.
For the receivables collection period, a relatively long receivables collection period means that the company is
having trouble collecting cash from its customers and so whatever can be done to speed up collections while
still offering competitive credit terms should be pursued by financial managers. For example, companies that
converted paper invoicing to e-invoicing most likely reduce the average collection period by some number of
days, as it makes sense that if a bill is transmitted electronically, lag time is cut (no delays because of “snail
mail”) and collections (payments back to the company from customers) may happen sooner. Other credit
management techniques, some of which are explained in subsequent sections, can help minimize and control
the receivables collection period.
The payables deferral period is the one element that probably cannot be optimized without violating credit
terms. Certainly, cash balances can be conserved by delaying payments to vendors for as long as possible;
however, payments on trade credit need to be made on time or the company’s relationship with the supplier
can suffer. In a worst-case scenario, the company’scredit ratingcould also deteriorate.
A credit rating, also called a credit score, is a measure produced by an independent agency indicating the

likelihood that a company will meet its financial obligations as they come due; it is an indication of the

THINK IT THROUGH
The Cash Conversion Cycle
Considering the previous Think It Through (Scenario 1), what if you could reduce inventory levels, hold
lower accounts receivable balances, and rely more heavily on accounts payable while maintaining the same
sales level?
Here’s Scenario 2. Because of better inventory management, credit and collections management, and
negotiation of longer payment periods with vendors, King Sized Products (KSP) Inc. needs less investment
in inventory and accounts receivable and is able to utilize a greater amount of trade credit financing.
Annual credit sales are $40,000,000, average inventory is $2,800,000, average accounts receivable are
$5,500,000, average accounts payable are $3,300,000, and cost of goods sold is $30,000,000. What is the
cash conversion cycle?
Solution:
Inventory conversion period:

•
•
Receivables collection period:

•
Payables deferral period:

Notice that the investment in inventory and accounts receivable is less and the average accounts payable is
more with no change in credit sales and cost of goods sold—you would certainly anticipate a reduction in
the cash conversion cycle. The improvement would be about 13 days (from 57.2 in Scenario 1 to 44.1 days in
Scenario 2).Figure 19.4shows a bar chart comparison of the two scenarios.

A Harvard Business School blog post,How Amazon Survived the Dot-Com Bubble(https://openstax.org/r/
how-amazon-survived), discusses how Amazon managed its cash conversion cycle to the point where it was
receiving payment for the things it sold before Amazon had to pay for them. In that way, Amazon had a
negative cash conversion cycle (which is really a huge positive for a company trying to manage positive
cash flow!).
Working Capital Needs by Industry
When comparing working capital needs by industry, you can see some variation. For example, some
companies in the grocery business can have very low cash conversion cycles, while construction companies
can have very high cash conversion cycles. And some companies, like those in the restaurant business, can
have very low numbers and even have negative cash conversion cycles.
Working capital can also differ from one industry to another. An often cited general rule is that a current ratio
of 2 is considered optimal. However, general rules of thumb must be treated with caution. A better
benchmarkingapproach is to compare a firm’s ratios—current ratio and quick ratios—to the average of the
industry in which the subject company operates.
Take, for example, a home construction company. Such as firm has a longoperating cyclebecause of the
production process (building homes), and the “storage of finished goods” can result in very high current
ratios—such as 11 or 12 times current liabilities—whereas a retailer like Walmart or Target would have much
lower current ratios.
In recent years,Walmart Stores Inc.(NYSE: WMT) has had a current ratio of around 0.9 and has been able to
manage its working capital needs by efficient management of its supply chain, quick turnover of inventory,
and a very small investment in accounts receivables.

Big retailers like Walmart are effective at negotiating
favorable payment terms with their vendors. The ability to generate consistent positive cash flow from
operations allows a retailer like Walmart to operate with relatively low amounts of working capital.
The credit policies of a company also affect working capital. A company with a liberal credit policy will require a
greater amount of working capital, as collection periods of accounts receivable are longer and therefore tie up

more dollars in receivables.
Almost all businesses will have times when additional working capital is needed to pay bills, meet the payroll
(salaries and wages), and plan for accrued expenses. The wait for the cash to flow into the company’s treasury
from the collection of receivables and cash sales can be longer during tough times.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government made paycheck protection program (PPP) loans available
to help alleviate working capital problems for small and large business when the economy slowed because of
shutdowns and social distancing. And although 60 percent of the PPP loan proceeds were to go to cover
payroll-related costs, 40 percent could be used to bolster working capital to meet rent, utilities costs, and some
interest expense while companies were “treading water”—waiting for positive cash flow to pick up under a
recovery.
2
It isn’t just during downturns that working capital is strained. Growing companies, even if they are extremely
profitable, need additional working capital as they ramp up operations by acquiring raw materials, component
parts, supplies, or other forms of inventory; hiring temporary or additional employees; and taking on new
projects. Whenever additional resources are needed, working capital is also needed.
Some of the current assets and expenditures needed in a growing company may need to be financed from
sources that are not spontaneous financing—trade credit(accounts payable). Such forms of external
financing such as lines of credit, short-term bank loans, inventory-based loans (also calledfloor planning),
and thefactoringof accounts receivables might have to be relied upon.
19.2What Is Trade Credit?
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Compute the cost of trade credit.
•Define cash discount.
•Define discount period.
•Define credit period.
Trade credit, also known asaccounts payable, is a critical part of a business’s working capital management
strategy. Trade credit is granted by vendors to creditworthy companies when those companies purchase
materials, inventory, and services.
A company’s purchasing system is usually integrated with other functions such production planning and sales
forecasting. Purchasing managers search for and evaluate vendors, negotiate order quantities, and prepare
purchase orders. In carrying out the purchasing process, credit terms are granted by the company’s vendors
and purchases of inventory and services can be made on trade credit accounts—allowing the purchaser time
to pay. The purchaser carries an accounts payable balance until the account is paid.
Trade credit is referred to as spontaneous financing, as it occurs spontaneously with the gearing up of
operations and the additional investment in current assets. Think of it this way: If sales are increasing, so too is
production. Increased sales mean more current assets (accounts receivable and inventory), and increased
sales mean increases in accounts payable (financing happening spontaneously with increased sales and
inventory purchases). Compared to other financing arrangements, such as lines of credit and bank loans,
trade credit is convenient, simple, and easy to use.
Once a company is approved for trade credit, there is no paperwork or contracts to sign, as is the case with
various forms of bank financing. Invoices specify the credit terms, and there is usually no interest expense
associated with trade credit. Accounts payable is a type of obligation that is interest-free and is distinguished
from debt obligations, such as notes payable, that require the creditor to pay back principal and interest.

19.2 • What Is Trade Credit?575

How Trade Credit Works
Trade credit is common in B2B (business to business) transactions and is analogous to consumer spending
using a credit card. With a credit card, a consumer opens an account with a credit limit. Most trade credit is
offered to a company with an open account that has a credit limit up to which the company can purchase
goods or services without having to pay the cash up front. As long as the payments are made in accordance
with the terms of the agreement (also called credit terms), no interest or additional fees are charged on the
credit balance except possibly for a fee for late payment.
Initially, the vendor’s credit department approves both a trade credit limit and credit payment terms (i.e.,
number of days after the invoice date that payment is due). Timely payments on accounts payable (trade
credit) helps create a credit history for the purchasing firm.
Trade Credit Terms
Trade credit arrangements often carry credit terms that offer an incentive, called a discount, for a company
(the buyer) to pay its bill within a relatively short period of time.Net terms, also referred to as the fullcredit
period, are the number of days that a business (purchaser) has before they must pay their invoice. A common
net term is Net 30, with payment due in full within 30 days of the invoice.
Many vendors also offercash discountsto customers that pay their bill early. A company’s invoice that
specifies payment terms of “2/10 n/30” (stated as: “two ten net 30”) would allow a 2 percent discount if the
buyer’s account balance is paid within 10 days of the invoice date; otherwise, the net amount owed would be
due in 30 days. The “10 days” in the example is thediscount period—the number of days the buyer has to
take advantage of the cash discount for an early payment, also known asquick payment.
For example, Jackson’s Premium Jams Inc. received a $10,500 invoice for the purchase of jelly jars. The invoice
has payment terms of 2/10 n/30. Jackson’s pays the bill within 10 days of the invoice date. Jackson’s payment
would be. The effect of taking a discount because of a quick payment
is a lowering of the cost of inventory in the case of purchases of materials (for a manufacturer), merchandise
(for a retailer or wholesaler), and operating expenses (for any company that “buys” services using trade
credit). InCost of Trade Credit, there is an example that shows the high annualize opportunity cost (36.73
percent) of not taking advantage of cash discounts.
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
Trade Credit of International Trade
When international trade occurs, two important documents are commonly required: aletter of creditand
abill of lading. A letter of credit is issued by a financial institution on behalf of the foreign buyer
(importer). The bill of lading is a legal document that gives proof of a contract between a transportation
company and the buyer and is one important piece of documentation that allows the buyer to draw on the
letter of credit. A bill of lading serves as a document of title and proof of receipt of goods by the shipper.
The letter of credit secures a promise of payment to the seller (exporter) provided that the terms of the sale
are met. For an international trade transaction, the letter of credit is the main mechanism that establishes a
liability for the buyer. Instead of a trade payable, the buyer uses a line of credit from a bank.
Cost of Trade Credit
Trade credit is often referred to as a no-cost type of financing. Unlike with other credit arrangements (e.g.,
bank loans, lines of credit, and commercial paper), there is usually no interest expense associated with trade
credit, and as long as your account does not become delinquent, there are no special fees. Some accounts
payable arrangements specify an interest penalty or a late fee when the account goes delinquent, but as long
57619 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning
Access for free at openstax.org

as payments are made on time, trade credit is thought of as a low-cost source of working capital.
However, there is one possible cost associated with trade credit for companies that don’t take advantage of
cash discounts when offered by sellers. Using accounts payable to purchase goods and services can involve an
opportunity cost—a cost of the forgone opportunity of making a quick payment and benefiting from a cash
discount. A business that does not take advantage of a cash discount for early payment of trade credit will pay
more for goods and services than a business that routinely takes advantage of discounts.
The annual percentage rate of forgoing quick payment discounts can be estimated with the following formula:
Example: Novelty Accessories Inc. (NAI) purchases products from a vendor that offers credit payment terms of
2/10, net 30. The annual cost to NAI of not taking advantage of the discount for quick payment is 36.73
percent.
19.3Cash Management
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Explain why firms hold cash.
•List instruments available to a financial manager for investing cash balances.
Cash management means efficiently collecting cash from customers and managing cash outflows. To manage
cash, thecash budget—a forward-looking document—is an important planning tool. To understand cash
management, you must first understand what is meant by cash holdings and the motivations (reasons) for
holding cash. A cash budget example is covered inUsing Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan.
Cash Holdings
The cash holdings of a company are more than the currency and coins in the cash registers or the treasury
vault. Cash includes currency and coins, but usually those amounts are insignificant compared to the cash
holdings of checks to be deposited in the company’s bank account and the balances in the company’s
checking accounts.
Motivations for Holding Cash
The initial answer to the question of why companies hold cash is pretty obvious: because cash is how we pay
the bills—it is the medium of exchange. Thetransactional motiveof holding cash means that checks and
electronic funds transfers are necessary to meet the payroll (pay the employees), pay the vendors, satisfy
creditors (principal and interest payments on loans), and reward stockholders with dividend payments. Cash
for transaction is one reason to hold cash, but there is another reason—one that stems from uncertainty and
the precautions you might take to be ready for the unexpected.
Just as you keep cash balances in your checking and savings accounts and even a few dollars in your wallet or
purse for unexpected expenditures, cash balances are also necessary for a business to provide for unexpected
events. Emergencies might require a company to write a check for repairs, for an unexpected breakdown of
equipment, or for hiring temporary workers. This motive of holding cash is called theprecautionary motive.
Some companies maintain a certain amount of cash instead of investing it in marketable securities or in
upgrades or expansion of operations. This is called thespeculative motive. Companies that want to quickly
take advantage of unexpected opportunities want to be quick to purchase assets or to acquire a business, and
a certain amount of cash or quick access to cash is necessary to jump on an opportunity.
19.3 • Cash Management577

Sometimes cash balances may be required by a bank with which a company conducts significant business.
These balances are calledcompensating balancesand are typically a minimum amount to be maintained in
the company’s checking account.
For example, Jack’s Outback Restaurant Group borrowed $500,000 from First National Bank and Trust. As part
of the loan agreement, First National Bank required Jack’s to keep at least $50,000 in its company checking
account as a way of compensating the bank for other corporate services it provides to Jack’s Outback
Restaurant Group.
Cash Alternatives
Cash that a company has that is in excess of projected financial needs is often invested in short-term
investments, also known as cash equivalents (cash alternatives). The reason for this is that cash does not earn
a rate of return; therefore, too much idle cash can affect the profitability of a business.
Table 19.3shows a list of typical investment vehicles used by corporations to earn interest on excess cash.
Financial managers search for opportunities that are safe and highly liquid and that will provide a positive rate
of return. Cash alternatives, because of their short-term maturities, have low interest rate risk (the risk that an
investment’s value will decrease because of changes in market interest rates). In that way, prudent investment
of excess cash follows the risk/return trade-off; in order to achieve safe returns, the returns will be lower than
the possible returns achieved with risky investments. Cash alternative investments are not committed to the
stock market.

Figure19.5Note from Target Corporation 2021 10-K Filing(source: US Securities and Exchange Commission/EDGAR)
In that note, which is a supplement to the company’s balance sheet, receivables from third-party financial
institutions is also considered a cash equivalent. That is because purchases by Target’s customers who use
their credit cards (e.g.,VISAorMasterCard) create very short-term receivables—amounts that Target is waiting
to collect but are very close to a cash sale. So instead of being reported as accounts receivable—a line item on
the Target balance sheet that is separate from cash and cash equivalents—these amounts receivable from
third-party financial institutions are considered part of the cash and cash equivalents and are a very liquid asst.
For example, the amount of $560,000,000 for January 30, 2021, is considered a cash equivalent since the
settlement of these accounts will happen in a day or two with cash deposited in Target’s bank accounts. When
a retailer sells product and accepts a credit card such as VISA, MasterCard, orAmerican Express, the cash
collection happens very soon after the credit card sale—typically within 24 to 72 hours.

Companies also invest excess funds in marketable securities. These are debt and equity investments such as
corporate and government bonds, preferred stock, and common stock of other entities that can be readily sold
on a stock or bond exchange.Ford Motor Companyhas this definition of marketable securities in its 2019
Annual Report (Form 10-K):
“Investments in securities with a maturity date greater than three months at the date of purchase and other
securities for which there is more than an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted
price, or penalty on withdrawal are classified asMarketable securities.”

19.4Receivables Management
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Discuss how decisions on extending credit are made.
•Explain how to monitor accounts receivables.
For any business that sells goods or services on credit, effective accounts receivable management is critical for
cash flow and profitability planning and for the long-term viability of the company. Receivables management
begins before the sale is made when a number of factors must be considered.

•If the credit is approved, what will be the credit terms (i.e., how long do we give customers to pay their
bills)?
•Will there be a cash discount for quick payment?
•How much credit should be extended to each customer (credit limit)?
Accounts receivable is not about accepting credit cards. Credit card sales are not technically accounts
receivable. When a credit card is accepted, it means that the credit card company (e.g., VISA, MasterCard, or
American Express) will guarantee the payment. The cash will be deposited in the merchant’s bank account in a
very short period of time.
When a business makes a sale on account, management (e.g., a credit manager or analyst) does its best to
distinguish between customers who have a high likelihood of paying and customers who have a low likelihood.
Customers with low credit risk are approved; the decision is based on an effective analysis of creditworthiness.
Creditworthiness is judged by looking at a number of factors including an evaluation of the customer’s
financial statements, financial ratios, and credit reports (credit scores) based on a customer’s payment history
on credits owed to other firms. If a company has a prior relationship with a customer seeking trade credit, the
customer’s payment history with the firm is also carefully evaluated before additional credit is granted.
LINK TO LEARNING
Corporate Finance Institute
Credit managers use various tools and techniques to evaluate creditworthiness of customers. The
Corporate Finance Institute’s website states that “the ‘5 Cs of Credit’ is a common phrase used to describe
the five major factors [character, capacity, collateral, capital, and conditions] used to determine a potential
borrower’s creditworthiness.” It goes on to say that “a credit report provides a comprehensive account of
the borrower’s total debt, current balances, credit limits, and history of defaults andbankruptcies, if any.”
5
More on the 5 Cs of credit can be found on theCorporate Finance Institute’s website(https://openstax.org/
r/corporate-finance).
Determining the Credit Policy
A company’s credit policy encompasses rules of credit granting and procedures for the collections of accounts.
It’s how a company will process credit applications, utilize credit scoring and credit bureaus, analyze financial
statements, make credit limit decisions, and conduct collection efforts when accounts becomedelinquent(still
outstanding after their due date).
Establishing Credit Terms
Trade credit terms were discussed earlier. Recall that part of the terms and conditions of a sale are thecredit
terms—elements of a sales agreement (contract) that indicate when payment is due, possible discounts (for
quick payments), and any late fee charges.
If open credit is for a sales transaction, an agreement is made as to the length of time for which credit is to be
granted (payment period) and a discount for early payment. Although companies are free to establish credit
terms as they see fit, most companies look to the practice of the particular industry in which they operate. The
credit terms offered by the competition are a factor. Net terms usually range between 30 days and 90 days,
depending on the industry. Discounts for early payments also differ and are typically from 1 to 3 percent.
Establishing credit terms offered can be thought of as a decision process similar to setting a price for products
and services. Just as a price is the result of a market forces, so too are credit terms. If credit terms are not

competitive within the industry, sales can suffer. Typically, companies follow standard industry credit terms. If
most companies in an industry offer a discount for early payments, then most companies will follow suit and
also offer an equal discount.
Once credit terms are established, they can be changed based on both marketing strategies and financial
management goals. For example, discounts for early payments can be more generous, or the fullcredit
periodcan be extended to stimulate additional sales. Both discount periods and full credit periods can be
tightened to try to speed up collections. The establishment of and changes to credit terms are usually made in
consultation with the sales and financial management departments.
Monitoring Accounts Receivables
Financial managers monitor accounts receivables using some basic tools. One of those tools is theaccounts
receivable aging schedule(report). To prepare the aging schedule, a classifying of customer account
balances is performed with age as the sorting attribute.
An account receivable begins its life as a credit sale. The age of a receivable is the number of days that have
transpired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on
June 1 and is still unpaid on July 15, that receivable is 45 days old. Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful
tool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts
receivable will prove to be uncollectible.
An aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.
The receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible
percentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.
For example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an
uncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an
uncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a
total estimated uncollectible balance.
The aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating
how much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill
down to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.
Accountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as
bad debt expenseand to establish a sufficient balance in theallowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt
expense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts
receivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is acontra-asset(it will be deducted from accounts
receivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how
much of its accounts receivable will never be collected.
InFigure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is
$189,000. The company splits its accounts into four age categories: not due, 30 to 60 days past due, 61 to 90
days past due, and more than 90 days past due. Of the $189,000 owed to Foodinia by its customers, $75,500
($189,000 less $113,500) of invoices have been outstanding (not paid yet) beyond their due dates.
19.4 • Receivables Management581

Figure19.6Foodinia Inc. Aging of Accounts Receivable Schedule
In addition to preparing aging schedules, financial managers also use financial ratios to monitor receivables.
The accounts receivable turnover ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are
collected during an operating period and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that
receivables are collected quickly. In contrast, a lower accounts receivable turnover indicates that receivables
are collected at a slower rate, taking more days to collect from a customer.
Another receivables ratio is the number of days’ sales in receivables ratio, also called the receivables collection
period—the expected days it will take to convert accounts receivable into cash. A comparison of a company’s
receivables collection period to the credit terms granted to customers can alert management to collection
problems. Both the accounts receivable turnover ratio and receivables collection period are covered, including
the formulas for calculating the ratios, in the previous section of this chapter.
Accounts Receivables and Notes Receivable
An accounts receivable is an informal arrangement between a seller (a company) and customer. Accounts
receivable are usually paid within a month or two. Accounts receivable don’t require any complex paperwork,
are evidenced by an invoice, and do not involve interest payments. In contrast, a note receivable is a more
formal arrangement that is evidence by a legal contract called a promissory note specifying the payment
amount and date and interest.
The length of a note receivable can be for any time period including a term longer than the typical account
receivable. Some notes receivable have a term greater than a year. The assets of a bank include many notes
receivable (a loan made by a bank is an asset for the bank).
A note receivable can be used in exchange for products and services or in exchange for cash (usually in the
case of a financial lender). Sometimes a company might request that a slow-paying customer sign a note
promissory note to further secure the receivable, charge interest, or add some type of collateral to the
arrangement, in which case the receivable would be called a secured promissory note. Several characteristics
of notes receivable further define the contract elements and scope of use (seeTable 19.4).

19.5Inventory Management
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Outline the costs of holding inventory.
•Outline the benefits of holding inventory.
Financial managers must consider the impact of inventory management on working capital. Earlier in the
chapter, the concept of the inventory conversion cycle was covered. The number of days that goods are held
by a business is one of the focal points of inventory management.
Managers look to minimize inventory balances and raise inventory turnover ratios while trying to balance the
needs of operations and sales. Purchasing personnel need to order enough inventory to “feed” production or
to stock the shelves. The sales force wants to meet or surpass their sales budgets, and the operations people
need inventory for the factories, warehouses, and e-commerce sites.
The days in inventory ratio measures the average number of days between acquiring inventory (i.e.,
purchasing merchandise) and its sale. This ratio is a metric to be watched and monitored by inventory
managers and, if possible, minimized. A high days in inventory ratio could mean “aging” inventory. Old
inventory could mean obsolesce or, in the case of perishable goods, spoilage. In either case, old inventory
means losses.
Imagine a company selling high-tech products such as consumer electronics. A high days in inventory ratio
could mean that technologically obsolete products will be sold at a discount. There are similar issues with
older inventory in the fashion industry. Last year’s styles are not as appealing to the fashion-conscious
consumer and are usually sold at significant discounts. In the accounting world,lower of cost or market value
is a test of inventory value to determine if inventory needs to be “written down,” meaning that the company
takes an expense for inventory that has lost significant value. Lower of cost or market is required byGenerally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)to state inventory valuations at realistic and conservative values.
Inventory is a very significant working capital component for many companies, such as manufacturers,
wholesalers, and retailers. For those companies, inventory management involves management of the entire
supply chain: sourcing, storing, and selling inventory. At its very basic level, inventory management means
having the right amount of stock at the right place and at the right time while also minimizing the cost of
inventory. This concept is explained in the next section.
Inventory Cost
Controlling inventory costs minimizes working capital needs and, ultimately, the cost of goods sold. Inventory
management impacts profitability; minimizing cost of goods sold means maximizing gross profit (Gross Profit
= Net Sales Less Cost of Goods Sold).
There are four components to inventory cost:
•Purchasing costs: the invoice amount (after discounts) for inventory; the initial investment in inventory
19.5 • Inventory Management583

•Carrying costs: all costs of having inventory in stock, which includes storage costs (i.e., the cost of the
space to store the inventory, such as a warehouse), insurance, inventory obsolescence and spoilage, and
even the opportunity cost of the investment in inventory
•Ordering costs: the costs of placing an order with a vendor; the cost of a purchase and managing the
payment process
•Stockout costs: an opportunity cost incurred when a customer order cannot be filled and the customer
goes elsewhere for the product; lost revenue
Minimizing total inventory costs is a combination of many strategies, the scope and complexity of which are
beyond the scope of this text. Concepts such asjust-in-time(JIT)inventory practices andeconomic order
quantity (EOQ)are tools used by inventory managers, both of which help keep a company lean (minimizing
inventory) while making sure the inventory resources are in place in time to complete the sale.
Benefit of Holding Inventory
Brick-and-mortar stores need goods in stock so that the customer can see and touch the product and be able
to acquire it when they need it. Customers are disappointed if they cannot see and touch the item or if they
find out upon arrival at the store that it is out of stock.
Customers of all kinds don’t want to wait for the delivery of a purchase. We have become accustomed to
Amazon orders being delivered to the door the next day. Product fulfillment and availability is important.
Inventory must be in stock, or sales will be lost.
In manufacturing, the inventory of materials and component parts must be in place at the start of the value
chain (the conversion process), and finished goods need to be ready to meet scheduled shipments. Holding
sufficient inventory meets customer demand, whether it is products on the shelves or in the warehouse that
are ready to move through the supply chain and into the hands of the customer.
19.6Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Create a one-year budget.
•Create a cash budget.
A cash budget is a tool of cash management and therefore assists financial managers in the planning and
control of a critical asset. The cash budget, like any other budget, looks to the future. It projects the cash flows
into and out of the company. The budgeting process of a company is a really an integrated process—it links a
series of budgets together so that company objectives can be achieved. For example, in a manufacturing
company, a series of budgets such as those for sales, production, purchases, materials, overhead, selling and
administrative costs, and planned capital expenditures would need to be prepared before cash needs (cash
budget) can be predicted.
Just as you might budget your earnings (salary, business income, investment income, etc.) to see if you will be
able to cover your expected living expenses and planned savings amounts, to be successful and to increase
the odds that sufficient cash will be available in the months ahead, financial managers prepare cash budgets
to
•meet payrolls;
•allocate dollars for contingencies and emergencies;
•analyze if planned collections and disbursements policies and procedures result in adequate cash
balances; and
•plan for borrowings on lines of credit and short-term loans that might be needed to balance the cash
budget.
A cash budget is a model that often goes through several iterations before managers can approve it as the
58419 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning
Access for free at openstax.org

plan going forward. Changes in any of the “upstream” budgets—budgets that are prepared before the cash
budget, such as the sales, purchases, and production budgets—may need to be revised because of changing
assumptions. New economic forecasts and even cost-cutting measures will require a revision of the cash
budget.
Although a budget might be prepared for each month of a future 12-month period, such as the upcoming
fiscal year, a rolling budget is often used. A rolling budget changes often as the planning period (e.g., a fiscal
year) plays out. When one month ends, another month is added to the end (the next column) of the budget.
For example, if in your budget January is the first month of the planning period, once January is over, next
January’s cash budget column would be added—right after December’s column (at the far right of the
budget).
Sample One-Year (Annual) Operating Budget
Preparing an annual operating budget can be a complex task. In essence, a company budget is a series of
budgets, many of which are interrelated.
The sales budget is prepared first and has an impact on many other budgets. Take the example of a
production budget of a manufacturer. The sales budget impacts what needs to be produced (production
budget), and the production budget influences planned purchases of material (purchases budget), overhead
resources (overhead budget), and the amount of labor costs for the year ahead (direct labor budget.)
For a merchant (such as a wholesaler or retailer), the annual budget would be less complex than that of a
manufacturing firm but would still require an inventory purchases budget and an operating expense budget
(such as selling and administrative expenses). For a service firm, a purchase budget for inventory would not be
necessary, but an operating budget would be. All businesses need a cash budget, which is the topic of the next
section of this chapter.
The example operating budget presented here is of a merchandising company. Budgets are prepared
following a process that begins with a sales (or revenue) forecast. The sales forecast is normally based on
information obtained from both internal and external sources and predicts the amount of units to be sold in
the planning period—usually one year into the future.
A company’s management, in consultation with its marketing and sales executives, would prepare a sales
budget by making assumptions about the number of units that are expected to be sold and the prices that will
be charged. From the sales budget, projections are made as to cash receipts each month, and therefore
assumptions have to be made as to how much of each month’s sales will be cash sales and how much cash will
flow into the company from the collection credit sales (including cash flow in from the prior month’s sales).
Figure 19.7provides an example of a sales budget and projected accounts receivable collections and cash
sales for the months of January through December. Keep in mind that projected monthly sales amounts are
not equal to cash collected from sales. Because of sales on credit, some cash from sales lags credit sales as
collections can extend beyond the month of sale. Credit terms such terms such as net 30 (net amount owed to
be paid in 30 days) have to be considered when developing a forecasted cash collection pattern.
19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan585

Figure19.7Example of a Sales and Collections Budget
Download thespreadsheet file(https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet-file1)containing key Chapter 19
Excel exhibits.
Sales budgets “drive” the preparation of other budgets. If sales are expected to increase, purchases of
inventory and some operating expenses would also increase. To meet the demand for goods and services (as
defined in the sales budget), a purchases (inventory) budget would be prepared. In this example (Figure 19.8),
the purchases budget shows projected purchases of inventory (merchandise) and the projected payments
(also called disbursements) for each month.
Cash outflows as a result of purchases often do not equal the projected purchase amount. That is because
payments for purchases are usually on credit (accounts payable), and so purchases for one month typically get
spread out over a period of time that encompasses the current month and the month (or months) thereafter.
To keep this example simple, the assumption is that the purchases are paid for in the following month (an
average days payable outstanding of 30 days). However, in other cases, payment patterns may be based on
other payment periods such as 45, 60, or even 90 days, depending on the trade credit terms.
Figure19.8Purchases Budget
An operating expense budget is prepared next and is basically a prediction of the selling and administrative
expenditures of the company. Notice inFigure 19.9that in the operating expense budget, cost of goods sold
(an expense) is not included, nor are noncash expenses such as depreciation. The cash outlays related to
goods sold, at least in a merchandising operation, are accounted for in the purchases budget (payments for
purchases of inventory.)
With the sales, purchases, and operating expense budgets prepared, the cash budget can be prepared. Some
of the “inputs” to the cash budget are from the sales (collections of cash), purchases (payments), and the
operating expense budget (cash expenditures for selling and administrative expenses). A sample cash budget
and a discussion of its preparation follows in the next section of this chapter.

Sample Cash Budget
A cash budget is the last budget to be prepared and is often part of the financial budget (cash budget,
budgeted income statement, and budgeted balance sheet). The purpose of the cash budget is to estimate
cash flows, to help ensure sufficient cash balances are maintained during the planning period, and to plan for
external financing during periods of cash deficits.
When a budget is prepared inExcel, cash budget analysts can play “what if” with different scenarios to see
when cash surpluses and deficits are expected. Cash surpluses means that funds can be invested in
marketable securities to earn a rate of return, while cash deficits mean that financing, such as a line of credit,
will be necessary (assuming forecasts are accurate).
Although the example shown inFigure 19.10is a monthly cash budget, a cash budget could be prepared using
any useful time elements: weekly, monthly, or quarterly.
One common practice is to use a rolling cash budget. A rolling cash budget is continually updated to add a
new budget period, such as a month’s amount of cash flow activity, as the most recent budgeted month
expires. For example, assume that a 12-month cash budget is prepared for a period covering January 20X1 to
December 20X1. Once the month of January 20X1 has concluded, a 12-month planning period continues by
add January 20X2 to the last column of the budget. The rolling cash monthly budget is an extension of the
initial cash budget model, adding one month and thereby always extending cash flow projections one year
into the future.
Figure19.9Operating Expenses Budget
19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan587

Figure19.10Sample Cash Budget
UsingFigure 19.9as an example,Table 19.5shows the formulas that form the skeleton of a monthly cash
budget.
Beginning
Cash Balance
This is the amount of cash the company expects to have on the first day of the month. For
example, inFigure 19.10, cell B2 is the amount of cash on Jan. 1 to start the year (the planning
period). The remaining beginning cash balances for the months February through December
are the ending cash balances of the previous month. For example, February’s beginning cash
balance (C2) is referenced from cell B9 (ending cash balance for January).
Cash
Collections
These are the projected cash inflows from collections from customers (accounts receivable),
cash sales, and any other significant cash inflows, such as dividends and interest on
investments or sale of fixed assets. For example, the Cash Collections shown in the Sample
Cash Budget (Figure 19.10) are referenced from the Sales and Collections Budget (Figure
19.7). January’s Cash Collections (cell B3) in the Sample Cash Budget are from cell B12 of the
Sales and Collection Budget.
Cash
Disbursements
Cash disbursements are the projected cash outflows, such as those for operating expenses
and payment of payables. For example, Cash Disbursements in the Sample Cash Budget for
January (Figure 19.10) are the sum of January’s payments for purchases in the Purchases
Budget (Figure 19.8, cell B3) and the January operating expenses (Operating Expenses
Budget,Figure 19.9, cell B12).
Net Cash Flow
The formula for net cash flow is For example, inFigure 19.10, the January Net Cash Flow is
calculated in cell B5.
Preliminary
Ending Cash
Balance
Beginning Cash Balance + or - Net Cash Flow. This is the projected cash balance before taking
into account the target cash balance to be maintained (minimum cash balance). In the
Sample Cash Budget (Figure 19.10), the preliminary ending cash balance formula for January
is =B2+B5 (B2 is the Beginning Cash Balance and B5 is the Net Cash Flow for the month).
Less:
Minimum Cash
Balance
This is a target cash balance that management sets; it is the minimum amount of cash that
should be maintained by the company (inFigure 19.10, cells B2:G7 and B17:G17).

Cash Surplus
(Deficiency)
A cash surplus means that cash can be invested in marketable securities. A cash deficiency
means that some type of financing, such as a line of credit or bank loan, will be needed to
provide enough cash for operations and to maintain a minimum cash balance. This number is
found by subtracting the minimum cash balance from the preliminary ending cash balance.
For example, the cash surplus for January inFigure 19.10is calculated with this formula:
=B6-B7. Notice that all months in the Sample Cash Budget show a surplus except for August’s
forecast of a deficit, which may require drawing on a line of credit to provide enough cash to
meet obligations in August.

Summary
19.1What Is Working Capital?
Working capital is not only necessary to run a business; it is a resource that will expand and contract with
business cycles and must be carefully managed and monitored. The daily, weekly, and monthly needs of
business operations are met by cash. Financial managers understand the significance of net working capital
(current assets – current liabilities) and various liquidity ratios as they attempt to ensure that bills can be paid.
The cash conversion cycle and the cash budget provide additional working capital management tools.
19.2What Is Trade Credit?
Trade credit is very prevalent in the business world, especially in B2B (business-to-business) transactions.
Many business exchanges (sales) could not take place without trade credit and the credit terms that are
offered. Like any component of working capital, trade credit must be planned and managed. The creditor (the
company granting the credit) does so based on an analysis of creditworthiness and must monitor payments
and manage slow-paying accounts. The debtor (accounts payable) needs to make payments on time to keep a
clean credit history and to take advantage of discounts.
19.3Cash Management
Cash management is simply making sure you have enough cash to meet expected obligations and for
contingencies (unexpected or emergency cash needs). Excess cash should be invested low-risk and highly
liquid marketable securities. The cash budget is a critical tool of cash management.
19.4Receivables Management
Accounts receivables are monitored by management with tools such as the ratios accounts receivable turnover
and average collection period and the aging of receivables. The credit managers’ mantra rings true: “The
older the receivable, the greater the likelihood that the account will not be collected.”
19.5Inventory Management
Inventory, usually the least liquid of the current assets, presents its own set of management challenges.
Finding the optimal level of inventory is probably more of an art than a science. JIT helps to reduce the
investment in inventory and lower the costs of storage, but stockout costs can be very damaging to
profitability.
19.6Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan
Short-term plans of a business are funded with cash, with cash budgets being a critical tool of planning. The
cash budget takes into account a target amount of cash, factoring in all the motives for holding cash. A cash
budget looks ahead—predicting cash inflows and outflows, allocating for minimum cash balances to be
maintained, and helping management determine short-term financing needed. Although it is the last budget
prepared, the preparation of the cash budget is an important financial planning exercise of companies small
and large.

Each year,American Airlinesconsumes approximately four billion gallons of jet fuel.

In the spring of 2018, jet
fuel prices rose from an average of $2.07 per gallon to a price of $2.19 per gallon.
2
A $0.12-per-gallon increase
in the price of jet fuel may not seem significant, but on an annualized basis, a price increase of this magnitude
would increase the company’s jet fuel bill by approximately $500 million.
That added cost cuts into the profits of the company, leaving less money available to provide a return to the
company’s investors. Rising costs could even cause the business to become unprofitable and close, causing
many employees to lose their jobs. The financial managers of American Airlines are not able to control the
price of jet fuel. However, they must be aware of the risk that price volatility poses to the company and
consider prudent ways to manage this risk.

20.1The Importance of Risk Management
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Describe risk in the context of financial management.
•Explain how risk can impact firm value.
•Distinguish between hedging and speculating.
What Is Risk?
The job of the financial manager is to maximize the value of the firm for the owners, or shareholders, of the
company. The three major areas of focus for the financial manager are the size, the timing, and the riskiness
of the cash flows of the company. Broadly, the financial manager should work to
•increase cash coming into the company and decrease cash going out of the company;
•speed up cash coming into the company and slow down cash going out of the company; and
•decrease the riskiness of both money coming in and money going out of the company.
The first item in this list is obvious. The more revenue a company has, the more profitable it will be.
Businesspeople talk about “top line” growth when discussing this objective because revenue appears at the
top of the company’s income statement. Also, the lower the company’s expenses, the more profitable the
company will be. When businesspeople talk about the “bottom line,” they are focused on what will happen to
a company’s net income. The net income appears at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the
amount of revenue left over after all of the company’s expenses have been paid.
The second item in the list—the speed at which money enters and exits the company—has been addressed
throughout this book. One of the basic principles of finance is the time value of money—the idea that a dollar
received today is more valuable than a dollar received tomorrow. Many of the topics explored in this book
revolve around the issue of the time value of money.
The focus of this chapter is on the third item in the list: risk. In finance, risk is defined as uncertainty. Risk
occurs because you cannot predict the future. Compared to other business decisions, financial decisions are
generally associated with contracts in which the parties of the contract fulfill their obligations at different
points in time. If you choose to purchase a loaf of bread, you pay the baker for the bread as you receive the
bread; no future obligation arises for either you or the baker because of this purchase. If you choose to buy a
bond, you pay the issuer of the bond money today, and in return, the issuer promises to pay you money in the
future. The value of this bond depends on the likelihood that the promise will be fulfilled.
Because financial agreements often represent promises of future payment, they entail risk. Even if the party
that is promising to make a payment in the future is ethical and has every intention of honoring the promise,
things can happen that can make it impossible for them to do so. Thus, much of financial management hinges
on managing this risk.

mandated lockdowns. Locations that were able to service customers through drive-up windows were not
immune to declining revenue due to the pandemic. As fewer people gathered in the workplace, Starbucks
experienced a declining number of to-go orders from meeting attendees. In addition, Starbucks locations
faced the risk of illness spreading as baristas gathered in their buildings to fill to-go orders.
While COVID-19 brought discussions of risk to the forefront of everyday conversations, risk was an important
focus of companies such as Starbucks before the pandemic began. (The termriskappeared in the company’s
2019 annual report 82 times.

) Starbucks’s business model revolves around turning coffee beans into a
pleasurable drink. Anything that impacts the company’s ability to procure coffee beans, produce a drink, and
sell that drink to the customer will impact the company’s profitability.
The investors in the company have allowed Starbucks to use its capital to lease storefronts, purchase espresso
machines, and obtain all of the assets necessary for the company to operate. Debt holders expect interest to
be paid and their principal to be returned. Stockholders expect a return on their investment. Because investors
are risk averse, the riskier they perceive the cash flows they will receive from the business to be, the higher the
expected return they will require to let the company use their money. This required return is a cost of doing
business. Thus, the riskier the cash flows of a company, the higher the cost of obtaining capital. As any cost of
operating a business increases, the value of the firm declines.

The most recent annual report for Starbucks Corp., along with the reports from recent years, is available on
the company’s investor relations website under theFinancial Data section(https://openstax.org/r/
Financial_Data_section). Go to the most recent annual report for the company. Search for the wordriskin
the annual report, and read the discussions surrounding this topic. Note the major types of risk the
company discusses. Pay attention to the types of risk that Starbucks categorizes as uncontrollable and
which types of risk the company attempts to mitigate.
In the following sections, you will learn about some of the types of risk that firms commonly face. You will also
learn about ways in which firms can reduce their exposure to these risks. When firms take actions to reduce
their exposures to risk, they are said to behedging. Firms hedge to try to protect themselves from losses.
Thus, in finance, hedging is a risk management tool.
Certain strategies are commonly used by firms to hedge risk, which is part of corporate financial management.
Many of these same strategies can be used by economic players who wish to speculate.Speculatingoccurs
when someone bets on a future outcome. It involves trying to predict the future and profit off of that
prediction, knowing that there is some risk that an incorrect prediction will lead to a loss. Speculators bet on
the future direction of an asset price. Thus, speculation involves directional bets.
If you are concerned that the price of hand sanitizer is going to rise because people are concerned about a
new virus and you purchase a few extra bottles to keep on your shelf “just in case,” you are hedging. If you see
this situation as a business opportunity and purchase bottles of hand sanitizer, hoping that you can sell them
on eBay in a few weeks at twice what you paid for them, you are speculating.
In the popular press, you will often hear of some of the strategies in this chapter discussed in terms of people
using them to speculate. In upper-level finance courses, these strategies are discussed in more depth,
including how they might be used to speculate. In this chapter, however, the focus is on the perspective of a
financial manager using these strategies to manage risk.

One of the most significant risks that many companies face arises from normal business operations.
Companies purchase raw materials to produce the products and provide the services they sell. A change in the
market price of these raw materials can significantly impact the profitability of a company.
For example, Starbucks must purchase coffee beans in order to make its coffee drinks. The price of coffee
beans is highly volatile. Sample prices of a pound of Arabica coffee beans over the past couple of decades are
shown inTable 20.1. Over this period, the price of coffee beans ranged from a low of $0.52 per pound in the
summer of 2002 to a high of over $3.00 per pound in the spring of 2011. The costs, and thus the profits, of
Starbucks will vary greatly depending on if the company is paying less than $1.00 per pound for coffee or if it is
paying three times that much.

Long-Term Contracts
One method of hedging the risk of volatile input prices is for a firm to enter into long-term contracts with its
suppliers. Starbucks, for example, could enter into an agreement with a coffee farmer to purchase a particular
quantity of coffee beans at a predetermined price over the next several years.
These long-term contracts can benefit both the buyer and the seller. The buyer is concerned that rising
commodity prices will increase its cost of goods sold. The seller, however, is concerned that falling commodity
prices will mean lower revenue. By entering into a long-term contract, the buyer is able to lock in a price for its
raw materials and the seller is able to lock in its sales price. Thus, both parties are able to reduce uncertainty.
While long-term contracts reduce uncertainty about the commodity price, and thus reduce risk, there are
several possible disadvantages to these types of contracts. First, both parties are exposed to the risk that the
other party may default and fail to live up to the terms of the contract. Second, these contracts cannot be
entered into anonymously; the parties to the contract know each other’s identity. This lack of anonymity may
have strategic disadvantages for some firms. Third, the value of this contract cannot be easily determined,
making it difficult to track gains and losses. Fourth, canceling the contract may be difficult or even impossible.

Vertical Integration
A common method of handling the risk associated with volatile input prices isvertical integration, which
involves the merger of a company and its supplier. For Starbucks, a vertical integration would involve
Starbucks owning a coffee bean farm. If the price of coffee beans rises, the firm’s costs increase and the
supplier’s revenues rise. The two companies can offset these risks by merging.
Although vertical integration can reduce commodity price risk, it is not a perfect hedge. Starbucks may
decrease its commodity price risk by purchasing a coffee farm, but that action may expose it to other risks,
such as land ownership and employment risk.
Futures Contracts
Another method of hedging commodity price risk is the use of a futures contract. A commodity futures
contract is designed to avoid some of the disadvantages of entering into a long-term contract with a supplier.
Afutures contractis an agreement to trade an asset on some future date at a price locked in today. Futures
exist for a range of commodities, including natural resources such as oil, natural gas, coal, silver, and gold and
agricultural products such as soybeans, corn, wheat, rice, sugar, and cocoa.
Futures contracts are traded anonymously on an exchange; the market price is publicly observable, and the
market is highly liquid. The company can get out of the contract at any time by selling it to a third party at the
current market price.
A futures contract does not have the credit risk that a long-term contract has. Futures exchanges require
traders to postmarginwhen buying or selling commodities futures contracts. The margin, or collateral, serves
as a guarantee that traders will honor their obligations. Additionally, through a procedure known asmarking
to market, cash flows are exchanged daily rather than only at the end of the contract. Because gains and
losses are computed each day based on the change in the price of the futures contract, there is not the same
risk as with a long-term contract that the counterparty to the contract will not be able to fulfill their obligation.

The managers of companies that operate in the global marketplace face additional complications when
managing the riskiness of their cash flows compared to domestic companies. Managers must be aware of
differing business climates and customs and operate under multiple legal systems. Often, business must be
conducted in multiple languages. Geopolitical events can impact business relationships. In addition, the
company may receive cash flows and make payments in multiple currencies.
Exchange Rates
The costs to companies are impacted when the prices of the raw materials they use change. Very little coffee is
grown in the United States. This means that all of those coffee beans that Starbucks uses in its espresso
machines inSeattle,New York,Miami, andHoustonwere bought from suppliers outside of the United States.
Brazilis the largest coffee-producing country, exporting about one-third of the world’s coffee.
6
When a
company purchases raw materials from a supplier in another country, the company needs not just money but
the money that is used in that country to make the purchase. Thus, the company is concerned about the
exchange rate, or the price of the foreign currency.
Figure20.2Brazilian Reals to One US Dollar
7
The currency used in Brazil is called the Brazilian real.Figure 20.2shows how many Brazilian reals could be
purchased for $1.00 from 2010 through the first quarter of 2021. In March 2021, 5.4377 Brazilian reals could be
purchased for $1.00. This will often be written in the form of

BRL is an abbreviation for Brazilian real, and USD is an abbreviation for the US dollar. This price is known as a
currency exchange rate, or the rate at which you can exchange one currency for another currency.
If you know the price of $1.00 is 5.4377 Brazilian reals, you can easily find the price of Brazilian reals in US
dollars. Simply divide both sides of the equation by 5.4377, or the price of the US dollar:
If you have US dollars and want to purchase Brazilian reals, it will cost you $0.1839 for each Brazilian real you
want to buy.
The foreign exchange rate changes in response to demand for and supply of the currency. In early 2020, the
exchange rate was. In other words, $1 purchased fewer reals in early 2020 than in it did a
year later. Because you receive more reals for each dollar in 2021 than you would have a year earlier, the dollar
is said to haveappreciatedrelative to the Brazilian real. Likewise, because it takes more Brazilian reals to
purchase $1.00, the real is said to havedepreciatedrelative to the US dollar.
Exchange Rate Risks
Starbucks, like other firms that are engaged in international business, faces currency exchange rate risk.
Changes in exchange rates can impact a business in several ways. These risks are often classified as
transaction, translation, or economic risk.
Transaction Risk
Transaction riskis the risk that the value of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result
of a change in currency exchange rates. If Starbucks agrees to pay a Brazilian coffee grower seven million
Brazilian reals for an order of one million pounds of coffee beans, Starbucks will need to purchase Brazilian
reals to pay the bill. How much it will cost Starbucks to purchase these Brazilian reals depends on the
exchange rate at the time Starbucks makes the purchase.
In March 2021, with an exchange rate of, it would have cost Starbucks
to purchase the reals needed to receive the one million pounds of coffee
beans. If, however, Starbucks agreed in March to purchase the coffee beans several months later, in July,
Starbucks would not have known then what the exchange rate would be when it came time to complete the
transaction. Although Starbucks would have locked in a price of BRL 7,000,000 for one million pounds of coffee
beans, it would not have known what the coffee beans would cost the company in terms of US dollars.
If the US dollar appreciated so that it cost less to purchase each Brazilian real in July, Starbucks would find that
it was paying less than $1,287,300 for the coffee beans. For example, suppose the dollar appreciated so that
the exchange rate wasin July 2021. Then the coffee beans would only cost Starbucks
.
On the other hand, if the US dollar depreciated and it cost more to purchase each Brazilian real, then
Starbucks would find that its dollar cost for the coffee beans was higher than it expected. If the US dollar
depreciated (and the Brazilian real appreciated) so that the exchange rate wasin July
2021, then the coffee beans would cost Starbucks. This uncertainty
regarding the dollar cost of the coffee beans Starbucks would purchase to make its lattes is an example of
transaction risk.

Reserve Bank of St. Louis, accessed August 6, 2021. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DEXBZUS
20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk605

A global company such as Starbucks has transaction risk not only because it is purchasing raw materials in
foreign countries but also because it is selling its product—and thus collecting revenue—in foreign countries.
Customers in Japan, for example, spend Japanese yen when they purchase a Starbucks cappuccino, coffee
mug, or bag of coffee beans. Starbucks must then convert these Japanese yen to US dollars to pay the
expenses that it incurs in the United States to produce and distribute these products.
The Japanese yen–US dollar foreign exchange rates from 2011 through the first quarter of 2021 are shown in
Figure 20.3. In 2012, $1.00 could be purchased with fewer than 80 Japanese yen. In 2015, it took over 120 yen to
purchase $1.00.
Figure20.3Japanese Yen to One US Dollar
8
If a company is receiving yen from customers and paying expenses in dollars, the company is harmed when
the yen depreciates relative to the dollar, meaning that the yen the company receives from its customers can
be exchanged for fewer dollars. Conversely, when the yen appreciates, it takes fewer yen to purchase each
dollar; this appreciation of the yen benefits companies with revenues in yen and expenses in dollars.
THINK IT THROUGH
Projecting Sales in US Dollars
The managers of a firm think that the exchange rate of Japanese yen to US dollars will be
next year. If the company thinks that it will have sales of 50 million yen next year, how
much will it project these sales will be worth in dollars? What happens if the actual exchange rate over the
next year is?
Solution:
An exchange rate ofimplies that. If the company expects to have
sales of JPY 50,000,000, it is expecting sales to be worth USD 500,000. If the exchange rate is really
, this is the same as. With this exchange rate, JPY 50,000,000 in
sales would be equivalent to USD 415,000. The company would receive $85,000 less from these sales in
Japan than it was expecting, even if it met its goals as far as the number of units of items sold.

Translation Risk
In addition to the transaction risk, if Starbucks holds assets in a foreign country, it facestranslation risk.
Translation risk is an accounting risk. Starbucks might purchase a coffee plantation inCosta Ricafor 120
million Costa Rican colones. This land is an asset for Starbucks, and as such, the value of it should appear on
the company’s balance sheet.
The balance sheet for Starbucks is created using US dollar values. Thus, the value of the coffee plantation has
to be translated to dollars. Because exchange rates are volatile, the dollar value of the asset will vary
depending on the day on which the translation takes place. If the exchange rate is 500 colones to the dollar,
then this coffee plantation is an asset with a value of $240,000. If the Costa Rican colón depreciates to 600
colones to the dollar, then the asset has a value of only $200,000 when translated using this exchange rate.
Although it is the same piece of land with the same productive capacity, the value of the asset, as reported on
the balance sheet, falls as the Costa Rican colón depreciates. This decrease in the value of the company’s
assets must be offset by a decrease in the stockholders’ equity for the balance sheet to balance. The loss is
due simply to changes in exchange rates and not the underlying profitability of the company.
Economic Risk
Economic riskis the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers or its
sales. Even a company that is not involved in international transactions can face this type of risk. Consider a
company located in Mississippi that makes shirts using 100% US-grown cotton. All of the shirts are made in the
United States and sold to retail outlets in the United States. Thus, all of the company’s expenses and revenues
are in US dollars, and the company holds no assets outside of the United States.
Although this firm has no financial transactions involving international currency, it can be impacted by
changes in exchange rates. Suppose the US dollar strengthens relative to the Vietnamese dong. This will allow
US retail outlets to purchase more Vietnamese dong, and thus more shirts from Vietnamese suppliers, for the
same amount of US dollars. Because of this, the retail outlets experience a drop in the cost of procuring the
Vietnamese shirts relative to the shirts produced by the firm in Mississippi. The Mississippi company will lose
some of its customers to theseVietnamese producerssimply because of a change in the exchange rate.
Hedging
Just as companies may practice hedging techniques to reduce their commodity risk exposure, they may
choose to hedge to reduce their currency risk exposure. The types of futures contracts that we discussed
earlier in this chapter exist for currencies as well as for commodities. A company that knows that it will need
Koreanwon later this year to purchase raw materials from aSouth Koreansupplier, for example, can purchase
a futures contract for Korean won.
While futures contracts allow companies to lock in prices today for a future commitment, these contracts are
not flexible enough to meet the risk management needs of all companies. Futures contracts are standardized
contracts. This means that the contracts have set sizes and maturity dates. Futures contracts for Korean won,
for example, have a contract size of 125 million won. A company that needs 200 million won later this year
would need to either purchase one futures contract, hedging only a portion of its needs, or purchase two
futures contracts, hedging more than it needs. Either way, the company has remaining currency risk.
In this next section, we will explore some additional hedging techniques.
Forward Contracts
Suppose a company needs access to 200 million Korean won on March 1. In addition to a specified contract
size, currency futures contracts have specified days on which the contracts are settled. For most currency
futures contracts, this occurs on the third Wednesday of the month. If the company needed 125 million Korean
won (the basic contract size) on the third Wednesday of March (the standard settlement date), the futures
20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk607

contract could be useful. Because the company needs a different number of Korean won on a different date
from those specified in the standard contract, the futures contract is not going to meet the specific risk
management needs of the company.
Another type of contract, theforward contract, can be used by this company to meet its specific needs. A
forward contract is simply a contractual agreement between two parties to exchange a specified amount of
currencies at a future date. A company can approach its bank, for example, saying that it will need to purchase
200 million Korean won on March 1. The bank will quote a forward rate, which is a rate specified today for the
sale of currency on a future date, and the company and the bank can enter into a forward contract to
exchange dollars for 200 million Korean won at the quoted rate on March 1.
Because a forward contract is a contract between two parties, those two parties can specify the amount that
will be traded and the date the trade will occur. This contract is similar to your agreeing with a hotel that you
will arrive on March 1 and rent a room for three nights at $200 per night. You are agreeing today to show up at
the hotel on a future (specified) date and pay the quoted price when you arrive. The hotel agrees to provide
you the room on March 1 and cannot change the price of the room when you arrive. With a forward contract,
you are also agreeing that you will indeed make the purchase and you cannot change your mind; so, using the
hotel room analogy, this would mean that the hotel will definitely charge your credit card for the agreed-upon
$200 per night on March 1.
The forward contract is an individualized contract between the buyer and the seller; they are both under a
contractual obligation to honor the contract. Because this contract is not standardized like the futures contract
(so that it can be traded on an exchange), it can be tailored to the needs of the two parties. While the forward
contract has the advantage of being fine-tuned to meet the company’s needs, it has a risk, known as
counterparty risk, that the futures contract does not have. The forward contract is only as good as the promise
of the counterparty. If the company enters into a forward contract to purchase 200 million Korean won on
March 1 from its bank and the bank goes out of business before March 1, the company will not be able to
make the exchange with a nonexistent bank. The exchanges on which futures contracts are traded guard the
purchaser of a futures contract from this type of risk by guaranteeing the contract.
Natural Hedges
A hedge simply refers to a reduction in the risk or exposure that a company has to volatility and uncertainty.
We have been focusing on how a company might use financial market instruments to hedge, but sometimes a
company can use anatural hedgeto mitigate risk. A natural hedge occurs when a business can offset its risk
simply through its own operations. With a natural hedge, when a risk occurs that would decrease the value of
a company, an offsetting event occurs within the firm that increases the value of the company.
As an example, consider aBritish-based travel agency. One of the major tours the company offers is a tour of
Italy. The company arranges for transportation, lodging, meals, and sightseeing for Brits to visit the highlights
ofRome,Florence, andVenice. Because the company charges customers in British pounds but must pay the
bus companies, hotels, and other service providers in Italy in euros, the travel agency faces significant
transaction exposure. If the value of the British pound depreciates after the company sets the price it will
charge for the tour but before it pays the Italian suppliers, the company will be harmed. In fact, if the British
pound depreciates by a great deal, the company could end up in a situation in which the British pounds it
collects are not enough to purchase the euros it needs to pay its suppliers.
The company could create a natural hedge by offering tours ofLondonto individuals living in theEuropean
Union. The travel agency could charge people who live inGermany, Italy,Spain, or any other country that has
the euro as its currency for a travel package to London. Then the agency would pay British restaurants, tour
guides, hotels, and bus companies in British pounds. This segment of the business also has currency risk. If
the British pound depreciates, the company gains because the euros it collects from its EU customers will
purchase more British pounds than before.

Thus, the company has created a situation in which if the Britishpounddepreciates, the decrease in value of
its tours of Italy is exactly offset by the increase in value of its tours of London. If the British pound
appreciates, the opposite occurs: the company experiences a gain in its division that charges British pounds
for tourists traveling to Italy and an offsetting loss in its division that charges euros for tourists traveling to
London.
Options
A financialoptiongives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell an asset for a specified
price at some future date. Options are consideredderivativesecurities because the value of a derivative is
derived from, or comes from, the value of another asset.
Options Terminology
Specific terminology is used in the finance industry to describe the details of an options contract. If the owner
of an option decides to purchase or sell the asset according to the terms of the options contract, the owner is
said to beexercisingthe option. The price the option holder pays if purchasing the asset or receives if selling
the asset is known as thestrike priceorexercise price. The price the owner of the option paid for the option is
known as thepremium.
An option contract will have anexpiration date. The most common kinds of options areAmerican options,
which allow the holder to exercise the option at any time up to and including the expiration date. Holders of
European optionsmay exercise their options only on the expiration date. The labelsAmerican optionand
European optioncan be confusing as they have nothing to do with the location where the options are traded.
Both American and European options are traded worldwide.
Option contracts are written for a variety of assets. The most common option contracts are options on shares
of stock. Options are traded for US Treasury securities, currencies, gold, and oil. There are also options on
agricultural products such as wheat, soybeans, cotton, and orange juice. Thus, options can be used by financial
managers to hedge many types of risk, including currency risk, interest rate risk, and the risk that arises from
fluctuations in the prices of raw materials.
Options are divided into two main categories, call options and put options. Acall optiongives the owner of
the option the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset. Aput optiongives the owner the
right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset.
Call Options
If a Korean company knows that it will need pay a $100,000 bill to a US supplier in six months, it knows how
many US dollars it will need to pay the bill. As a Korean company, however, its bank account is denominated in
Korean won. In six months, it will need to use its Korean won to purchase 100,000 US dollars.
The company can determine how many Korean won it would take to purchase $100,000 today. If the current
exchange rate is, then it will need KWN 110,000,000 to pay the bill. The current
exchange rate is known as thespot rate.
The company, however, does not need the US dollars for another six months. The company can purchase a call
option, which is a contract that will allow it to purchase the needed US dollars in six months at a price stated in
the contract. This allows the company to guarantee a price for dollars in six months, but it does not obligate
the company to purchase the dollars at that price if it can find a better price when it needs the dollars in six
months.
The price that is in the contract is called thestrike price (exercise price). Suppose the company purchases a
call contract for US dollars with a strike price of KWN 1,200/USD. While this contract would be for a set size, or
a certain number of US dollars, we will talk about this transaction as if it were per one US dollar to highlight
how options contracts work.
20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk609

The company must pay a price, known as thepremium, to purchase this call option contract. For our example,
let’s assume the premium for the call option contract is KWN 50. In other words, the company has paid KWN
50 for the right to buy US dollars in six months for a price of KWN 1,200/USD.
In six months, the company makes a choice to either (1) pay the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD or (2) let the
option expire. If the company chooses to pay the strike price and purchase the US dollars, it is exercising the
option. How does the company choose which to do? It simply compares the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD to
the market, or spot, exchange rate at the time the option is expiring.
If, six months from now, the spot exchange rate is, it will be cheaper for the company
to buy the US dollars it needs at the spot price than it would be to buy the dollars with the option. In fact, if the
spot rate is anything below, the company will not choose to exercise the option. If,
however, the spot exchange rate in six months is, the company will exercise the option
and purchase each US dollar for only KWN 1,200.
The profitability, or the payoff, to the owner of a call option is represented by the chart inFigure 20.4below.
Possible spot prices are measured from left to right, and the financial gain or loss to the company of the
option contract is measured vertically. If the spot price is anything less than KWN 1,200/USD, the option
expires without being exercised. The company paid KWN 50 for something that ended up being worthless.
Figure20.4The Payoff to the Holder of a Call Option
If, in six months, the spot exchange rate is, then the company will choose to exercise
the option. The company will be saving KWN 25 for each dollar purchased, but the company originally paid 50
KWN for the contract. So, the company will be 25 KWN worse off than if it had never purchased the call option.
If the spot exchange rate is, the company will be in exactly the same position having
purchased and exercised the call option as it would have been if it had not purchased the option. At any spot
price higher than KWN 1,250/USD, the firm will be in a better financial position, or will have a positive payoff,
because it purchased the call option. The more the Korean won depreciates over the next six months, the
higher the payoff to the firm of owning the call contract. Purchasing the call contract is a way that the
company can protect itself from the currency exposure it faces.
For any transaction, there must be two parties—a buyer and a seller. For the company to have purchased the
call option, another party must have sold the call option. The seller of a call option is called theoption writer.
Let’s consider the potential benefits and risks to the writer of the call option.
When the company purchases the call option, it pays the premium to the writer. The writer of the option does
not have a choice regarding whether the option will be exercised. The purchaser of the option has the right to
make the choice; in essence, the writer of the option sold the right to make that decision to the purchasers of
the call option.

Figure 20.5shows the payoff to the writer of the call option. Recall that the buyer of the call option will let the
option expire if the spot rate is less thanwhen the call option matures in six months. If
this occurs, the writer of the option collected the KWN 50 option premium when the contract was sold and
then never hears from the purchaser again. This is what the writer of the option is hoping for; the writer of the
call option profits when the options contract is not exercised
Figure20.5The Payoff to the Writer of a Call Option
If the spot rate is above, then the holder of the option will choose to exercise the right
to purchase the won at the option strike price. Then the writer of the option will be obligated to sell the Korean
won at a price of KWN 1,200/USD. If the spot rate is, the option writer will be obligated
to sell the dollars for KWN 50 less than what they are worth; because the option writer was initially paid a KWN
50 premium for taking on that obligation, the option writer will just break even. For any exchange rate higher
than, the writer of the call option will have a loss.
The option contract is a zero-sum game. Any payoff the owner of the option receives is exactly equal to the
loss the writer of the option has. Any loss the owner of the option has is exactly equal to the payoff the writer
of the option receives.
Put Options
While the call option you just considered gives the owner the right to buy an underlying asset, the put option
gives the owner to right to sell an underlying asset. Take, for example, an Indian company that has a contract
to provide graphic artwork for a US company. The US company will pay the Indian company 200,000 US dollars
in three months.
While the Indian company receives US dollars, it must pay its workers in Indian rupees. Because the company
does not know what the spot exchange rate will be in three months, it faces transaction risk and may be
interested in hedging this exposure using a put option.
The company knows that the current spot rate is, meaning that the company would be able
to use $200,000 to purchaseif it possessed the $200,000 today. If
the Indian rupee appreciates relative to the US dollar over the next three months, however, the company will
receive fewer rupees when it makes the exchange; perhaps the company will not be able to purchase enough
rupees to cover the wages of its employees.
Assume the company can purchase a put option that gives it the right to sell US dollars in three months at a
strike price of INR 75/USD; the premium for this put option is INR 5. By purchasing this put option, the
company is spending INR 5 to guarantee that it can sell its US dollars for rupees in three months at a price of
INR 75/USD.
20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk611

If, in three months, when the company receives payment in US dollars, the spot exchange rate is higher than
, the company will simply exchange the US dollars for rupees at that exchange rate, allowing
the put option to expire without exercising it. The payoff to the company for the option is INR -5, the premium
that was paid for the option that was never used (seeFigure 20.6).
Figure20.6The Payoff to the Holder of a Put Option
If, however, in three months, the spot exchange rate is anything less than, then the
company will choose to exercise the option. If the spot rate is betweenand
, the payoff for the option is negative. For example, if the spot exchange rate is
, the company will exercise the option and receive three more Indian rupees per dollar than
it would in the spot market. However, the company had to spend INR 5 for the option, so the payoff is INR -2.
At a spot exchange rate of, the company has a zero payoff; the benefit of exercising the
option, INR 5, is exactly equal to the price of purchasing the option, the premium of INR 5.
If, in three months, the spot exchange rate is anything below, the payoff of the put option is
positive. At the theoretical extreme, if the USD became worthless and would purchase no rupees in the spot
market when the company received the dollars, the company could exercise its option and receive INR 75/USD,
and its payoff would be INR 70.
Now that we have considered the payoff to a purchaser of a put contract, let’s consider the opposite side of
the contract: the seller, or writer, of the put option. The writer of a put option is selling the right to sell dollars
to the purchaser of the put option. The writer of the put option collects a premium for this. The writer of the
put has no choice as to whether the put option will be exercised; the writer only has an obligation to honor the
contract if the owner of the put option chooses to exercise it.
The owner of the option will choose to let the option expire if the spot exchange rate is anything above
. If that is the case, the writer of the put option collects the INR 5 premium for writing the
put, as shown by the horizontal line inFigure 20.7. This is what the writer of the put is hoping will occur.

Figure20.7The Payoff to the Writer of a Put Option
The owner of the option will choose to exercise the option if the exchange rate is less than.
If the spot exchange rate is betweenand, the writer of the put option has
a positive payoff. Although the writer must now purchase US dollars for a price higher than what the dollars
are worth, the INR 5 premium that the writer received when entering into the position is more than enough to
offset that loss.
If the spot exchange rate drops below, however, the writer of the put option is losing more
than INR 5 when the option is exercised, leaving the writer with a negative payoff. In the extreme, the writer of
the put will have to purchase worthless US dollars for INR 75/USD, resulting in a loss of INR 70.
Notice that the payoff to the writer of the put is the negative of the payoff to the holder of the put at every
spot price. The highest payoff occurs to the writer of the put when the option is never exercised. In that
instance, the payoff to the writer is the premium that the holder of the put paid when purchasing the option
(seeFigure 20.7).
Table 20.2provides a summary of the positions that the parties who enter into options contract are in.
Remember that the buyer of an option is always the one purchasing the right to do something. The seller or
writer of an option is selling the right to make a decision; the seller has the obligation to fulfill the contract
should the buyer of the option choose to exercise the option. The most the seller of an option can ever profit is
by the premium that was paid for the option; this occurs when the option is not exercised.

20.4Interest Rate Risk
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•Describe interest rate risk.
•Explain how a change in interest rates changes the value of cash flows.
•Describe the use of an interest rate swap.
An interest rate is simply the price of borrowing money. Just as other prices are volatile, interest rates are also
volatile. Just as volatility in other prices leads to uncertain cash flows for a company, volatility in interest rates
can also lead to uncertain cash flows.
Measuring Interest Rate Risk
Suppose that a company is supposed to pay a bill of $1,000 in 10 years. The present value of this bill depends
on the level of interest rates. If the interest rate is 5%, the present value of the bill is. If
the interest rate rises to 6%, the present value of the bill is. The increase in the interest
rate by 1% causes the present value of the expected cash flow to fall by.
Interest rate risk can be highlighted by looking at bonds. Consider two $1,000 face value bonds with a 5%
coupon rate, paid semiannually. One of the bonds matures in five years, and the other bond matures in 30
years. If the market interest rate is 5%, each of these bonds will sell for face value, or $1,000. If, instead, the
market interest rate is 6%, the five-year bond will sell for $957.35 and the 30-year bond will sell for $861.62.
Notice that as the interest rate rises, the price of both of these bonds will fall. However, the price of the longer-
term bond will fall by more than the price of the shorter-term bond. The longer-term bond price will fall by
1.38%; the shorter-term bond price will fall by only 0.43%.
Consider two additional $1,000 face value bonds. The difference is that these bonds have a 6% coupon rate,
paid semiannually. If a bond has a 6% coupon rate and matures in five years, it will sell for $1,043.76 when the
market interest rate is 5%. A 30-year bond that matures in 30 years and has a 6% coupon rate will sell for
$1,154.54 when the market interest rate is 5%. However, if the interest rate in the economy is 6%, both of these
bonds will sell for a price of $1,000. The price of the five-year bond will drop by 4.19%; the price of the 30-year
bond will drop by 13.39%.
THINK IT THROUGH
Calculating Bond Prices as the Interest Rates Changes
You are considering purchasing a $10,000 face value bond with a 4% coupon rate, paid semiannually, that
matures in 20 years. If you require a 5% return to purchase this bond, what is the maximum price you
61420 • Risk Management and the Financial Manager
Access for free at openstax.org

would be willing to pay for the bond? If, instead, you require an 8% return to purchase this bond, what is
the maximum price you would be willing to pay for the bond?
Solution:
If the bond pays coupon interest semiannually, you will receive one-half of the face value of the bond
multiplied by the coupon rate every six months. So, you will receive 40 coupon payments of
. At maturity, you will receive one lump sum of the face value of the bond. Follow
the steps inTable 20.3to calculate the price of the bond if you require a 5% return, using a financial
calculator.

Thus, if interest rates rise because of changing market conditions, the price of bonds will fall.
The sensitivity of bond prices to changes in the interest rate is known as interest rate risk.Durationis an
important measure of interest rate risk that incorporates the maturity and coupon rate of a bond as well as
the level of current market interest rates. Calculating duration is a complex topic that is beyond the scope of
this introductory textbook, but it is useful to note that
•the higher the duration of a bond, the more sensitive the price of the bond will be to interest rate

•the duration of a bond will be higher the longer the maturity of the bond, all else being equal; and
•the duration of a bond will be higher the lower the coupon rate on the bond, all else being equal.
Swap-Based Hedging
As the name suggests, aswapinvolves two parties agreeing to swap, or exchange, something. Generally, the
two parties, known as counterparties, are swapping obligations to make specified payment streams.
To illustrate the basics of how an interest rate swap works, let’s consider two hypothetical companies, Alpha
and Beta. Alpha is a strong, well-established company with a AAA (triple-A) bond rating. This means that Alpha
has the highest rating a company can have. With this high rating, Alpha can borrow at relatively low interest
rates. Often, companies in this situation will borrow at a floating rate. This means that their interest rate goes
up and down as interest rates in the overall economy vary. The floating rate will be tied to a benchmark rate
that is widely quoted in the financial press. Historically, companies have often used theLondon Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR)as the benchmark rate. Because published quotes for LIBOR will be phased out by 2023,
firms are beginning to use alternative rates. As of yet, no single alternative has emerged as the most
commonly used rate; therefore, LIBOR will be used in our example. Suppose that Alpha finds that it can
borrow money at rate equal to; thus, if LIBOR is 2.75%, the company will pay 3.0% to borrow.
If the company wants to borrow at a long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 5.0%.
LINK TO LEARNING
LIBOR Transition
Although the basic principles of financial transactions remain the same over time, the particular financial
instruments used change from time to time. Innovation, regulation, and technological advances lead to
these changes in financial instruments. The use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate is winding down in the early
2020s. To find out more about this transition and how it impacts companies, visit theAbout LIBOR
Transition(https://openstax.org/r/About_LIBOR_Transition)website.
Beta has a BBB bond rating. Although this is considered a good, investment-grade rating, it is lower than the
rating of Alpha. Because Beta is less creditworthy and a bit riskier than Alpha, it will have to pay a higher
interest rate to borrow money. If Beta wants to borrow money at a floating rate, it will need to pay
If LIBOR is 2.75%, Beta must pay 3.5% on its floating rate debt. In order for Beta to borrow at
a long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 6.75%.
Let’s consider how these two companies can enter into a swap in which both parties benefit.Table 20.5
summarizes the situation and the rates at which Alpha and Beta can borrow. It also illustrates a way in which
an interest rate swap can benefit both Alpha and Beta.

Table20.5Example of a Swap Agreement
Alpha borrows in the capital markets at a fixed rate of 5%. Beta chooses to borrow at a floating rate that equals
Beta also agrees to pay Alpha a fixed rate of 5.5%. In essence, Beta is paying 5.5% to
Alpha, 0.75% to its lender, and LIBOR to its lender.
In return, Alpha promises to pay Beta LIBOR. The exact amount that Alpha will pay to Beta fluctuates as LIBOR
fluctuates. However, from Beta’s perspective, the payment of LIBOR it receives from Alpha exactly offsets the
payment of LIBOR it makes to its lender. When LIBOR increases, the rate ofthat Beta is
paying to its lender increases, but the LIBOR rate it receives from Alpha also increases. When LIBOR decreases,
Beta receives less from Alpha, but it also pays less to its lender. Because the LIBOR it receives from Alpha is
exactly equal to the LIBOR it pays to its lender, Beta’s net amount of interest paid is 6.25%—the 5.5% it pays to
Alpha plus the 0.75% it pays to its lender.
Alpha is in the position of paying 5.0% to its lender and LIBOR to Beta while receiving 5.5% from Beta. This
means that Alpha’s net interest paid isAlpha is said to have swapped its fixed interest rate for
a floating rate. Because it is paying, it will experience fluctuating interest rates; however, as a
company with a AAA bond rating, it is a strong, creditworthy company that can withstand that interest rate
exposure. It would have cost Alphato borrow the money from its lenders at a variable rate.
By participating in this swap arrangement, Alpha has been able to lower its interest rate by 0.75%.
Through this swap arrangement, Beta has been able to fix its interest rate at 6.25% rather than having a
variable rate. This predictability is a benefit for a company, especially one that is in a bit more precarious
position as far as its creditworthiness and stability. The 6.25% Beta pays as a result of this arrangement is 0.5%
below the 6.75% it would have paid if it simply borrowed from its lenders at a fixed rate.

Summary
20.1The Importance of Risk Management
Risk arises due to uncertainty. The future is unpredictable. One job of the financial manager is to manage the
risks of both cash inflows and cash outflows. Investors are risk-averse. The riskier a firm’s cash flows are, the
higher the rate of return investors require to provide capital to the company.
20.2Commodity Price Risk
Companies do not know how much they will have to pay for raw materials in future months. The price of raw
materials will change as economic conditions change, impacting a company’s cost of goods sold and profits.
Some ways that a company can hedge this risk are through vertical integration, long-term contracts, and
futures contracts.
20.3Exchange Rates and Risk
Exchange rates are unpredictable. This leads to transaction risk, translation risk, and economic risk as currency
values change. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to make an exchange at a particular
rate on a given date in the future. Companies can use options to mitigate the risks. A call option gives the
holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset. A put option give the holder the right,
but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset.
20.4Interest Rate Risk
When interest rates increase, the present value of future cash flows decreases. Duration is a measure of
interest rate risk. A swap involves two parties agreeing to exchange something, often specified payment
streams.

the company is a farm in Greece. The Olive Orchard must pay the Greek farm 5.00 euros per liter of olive
oil it purchases. The Olive Orchard would like to purchase 7,000 liters of the Greek farm’s olive oil next
year. Currently, it costs 0.900 euros to purchase 1 US dollar. If the exchange rate remains constant, how
much will it cost the Olive Orchard (in US dollars) to purchase the 7,000 liters? If the exchange rate
changes so that it costs 0.8599 euros to purchase 1 US dollar, how much will it cost to purchase the 7,000
liters of olive oil?

Hedging at Southwest Airlines
Click to view content(https://openstax.org/r/Single_Biggest_Risk)
Jet fuel costs represent a major expense for airlines. Southwest Airlines has been known as the most
aggressive airline when it comes to hedging the risk of jet fuel cost volatility. In this interview, the CEO of
Southwest Airlines, Gary Kelly, discusses crude oil prices in the spring of 2012 and the impact on Southwest
Airlines.
1.How volatile are oil prices, and how large of an impact does that volatility have on the cost structure of an
airline?
2.Gary Kelly states that he sees fuel prices as the largest single business risk Southwest Airlines faces and
that hedging that risk has become more expensive. Why do you think it became more expensive for
Southwest Airlines to hedge this risk in 2012?

hedge for BMW?
